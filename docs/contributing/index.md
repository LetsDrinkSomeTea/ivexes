## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ivexes.git
cd ivexes

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/LetsDrinkSomeTea/ivexes.git
```

### 2. Development Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or bug fix branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

IVEXES uses strict code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
ruff format

# Check code quality
ruff check

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix
```

**Key Style Guidelines:**
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) for Python code
- Use [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Type hints are required for all public APIs
- Maximum line length: 88 characters

### Documentation

All code must be properly documented:

```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> List[str]:
    """Brief description of the function.

    Longer description providing more details about what the function
    does and how to use it.

    Args:
        param1: Description of the first parameter.
        param2: Description of the second parameter with default value.

    Returns:
        A list of strings containing the results.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If param1 is empty.
        TypeError: If param2 is not an integer.

    Example:
        Basic usage example:

        >>> result = example_function("hello", 5)
        >>> print(result)
        ['hello', 'world']
    """
    ...
```

### Testing

All new code must include tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

**Testing Guidelines:**
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Security

Security is paramount in IVEXES:

**Security Requirements:**
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure defaults
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Document security considerations

**Security Review Process:**
- All security-related changes require review
- Threat modeling for new features
- Penetration testing for major releases
