# Agents Overview

IVEXES provides multiple agent types for different security analysis scenarios. Each agent is designed with specific capabilities and use cases in mind.

## Agent Types

### Single Agent
The single agent is designed for focused security analysis tasks. It provides:

- Direct interaction model
- Specialized prompts for specific security scenarios
- Streamlined workflow for targeted analysis

### Multi Agent
The multi-agent system enables collaborative security analysis through:

- Distributed analysis capabilities
- Shared context and memory
- Coordinated attack surface exploration
- Parallel vulnerability assessment

## Agent Configuration

Agents can be configured through the settings system to customize:

- Analysis depth and scope
- Tool availability
- Resource constraints
- Output formatting

For detailed configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](../getting-started/configuration.md).

## Choosing the Right Agent

- **Single Agent**: Use for focused analysis, specific vulnerability research, or when you need deterministic behavior
- **Multi Agent**: Use for comprehensive security assessments, complex attack surface analysis, or when multiple perspectives are needed
