# Multi Agent

The Multi-Agent system enables collaborative security analysis through coordinated agents with shared context and memory.

## Architecture

The multi-agent system consists of:

- **Agent Pool**: Multiple specialized agents working in parallel
- **Shared Memory**: Common knowledge base for agent coordination
- **Context Manager**: Coordination and communication hub
- **Task Distributor**: Intelligent work allocation

## Key Features

### Collaborative Analysis
- Multiple agents working on different aspects simultaneously
- Shared findings and insights across the agent pool
- Consensus building for high-confidence results

### Shared Context
- Common memory pool for all agents
- Real-time information sharing
- Coordinated attack surface exploration

### Specialized Roles
- Each agent can have specific specializations
- Dynamic role assignment based on task requirements
- Expert knowledge distribution

## Use Cases

### Comprehensive Security Assessment
- Large-scale application security testing
- Infrastructure vulnerability assessment
- Multi-vector attack analysis

### Complex Attack Surface Analysis
- Distributed system security evaluation
- API security testing across multiple endpoints
- Cross-component vulnerability correlation

### Collaborative Research
- Joint vulnerability research projects
- Peer review of security findings
- Multi-perspective threat modeling

## Configuration

```python
from ivexes.agents.multi_agent import MultiAgent
from ivexes.agents.multi_agent.shared_context import MultiAgentContext

# Configure shared context
context = MultiAgentContext(
    max_agents=5,
    shared_memory_size="1GB",
    coordination_timeout=300
)

# Initialize multi-agent system
agents = MultiAgent(
    context=context,
    agent_specializations=["web", "binary", "network", "crypto"]
)
```

## Agent Coordination

### Memory Sharing
- **Agent Memory**: Individual agent knowledge and state
- **Shared Memory**: Common findings and context
- **Context Synchronization**: Real-time updates across agents

### Communication Patterns
- Broadcast updates to all agents
- Targeted communication between specialized agents
- Hierarchical reporting to coordination layer

## Example Usage

```python
# Initialize multi-agent system
agents = MultiAgent(num_agents=3)

# Start collaborative analysis
result = agents.analyze_target(
    target="https://example.com",
    scope=["web_app", "api", "infrastructure"]
)

# Access coordinated results
for agent_id, findings in result.agent_findings.items():
    print(f"Agent {agent_id}: {findings}")

print("Consensus findings:", result.consensus)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Define Agent Roles**: Assign specific specializations to agents
2. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Track agent performance and resource consumption
3. **Validate Consensus**: Verify multi-agent findings through manual review
4. **Configure Timeouts**: Set appropriate coordination timeouts
5. **Scale Appropriately**: Match agent count to problem complexity

## Coordination Strategies

### Parallel Analysis
- Independent analysis of different components
- Parallel execution for faster results
- Aggregation of findings

### Sequential Coordination
- Agents build on each other's findings
- Progressive refinement of analysis
- Ordered execution based on dependencies

### Hybrid Approach
- Combination of parallel and sequential strategies
- Dynamic coordination based on intermediate results
- Adaptive strategy selection

## Performance Considerations

- **Agent Count**: More agents don't always mean better results
- **Resource Limits**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Coordination Overhead**: Balance collaboration benefits with communication costs
- **Timeout Management**: Prevent deadlocks and infinite loops

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Agent synchronization problems
- Memory conflicts in shared context
- Coordination timeouts
- Resource exhaustion

### Debugging Tips
- Enable detailed logging for agent communication
- Monitor shared memory usage
- Track agent state transitions
- Review coordination messages
