# System Overview

IVEXES (Intelligent Vulnerability Exploration and Exploitation System) is a comprehensive AI-driven cybersecurity analysis framework.

## High-Level Architecture

IVEXES follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

- **Agent System**: AI-driven analysis engine (single and multi-agent)
- **Analysis Tools**: Code browser, sandbox, vector database, CVE search
- **Data Layer**: Configuration, storage, and caching
- **External Integrations**: Security APIs and development tools

## Design Principles

- **Security First**: Built with security considerations at every layer
- **Modularity**: Extensible component-based architecture
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and resource efficiency
- **Usability**: Intuitive interfaces and clear documentation

## Core Components

### Agent System
The intelligent analysis engine that orchestrates security assessments using AI agents.

### Analysis Tools
Specialized tools for different aspects of security analysis:
- Static code analysis
- Dynamic analysis in sandboxes
- Knowledge-based search and correlation
- Vulnerability research and intelligence

### Data Management
Robust data handling including configuration management, persistent storage, and intelligent caching.
