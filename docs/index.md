# IVExES - Intelligent Vulnerability Extraction & Exploit Synthesis

![IVEXES Logo](assets/logo.png)

**IVExES** is an advanced Python framework for cybersecurity vulnerability analysis and exploitation using multi-agent AI systems. It combines comprehensive knowledge bases (CWE, CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK) with dynamic analysis capabilities to provide automated, intelligent security assessment.

## Overview

IVExES transforms vulnerability analysis from a manual, time-intensive process into an automated, AI-driven workflow. By leveraging multiple specialized AI agents, the framework can analyze complex codebases, identify vulnerabilities, understand exploitation techniques, and generate comprehensive security reports.

### Key Features

!!! info "Multi-Agent Architecture"
    Specialized AI agents work collaboratively to analyze different aspects of security vulnerabilities, from code analysis to exploitation strategy development.

!!! success "Knowledge Base Integration"
    Seamlessly integrates with industry-standard security frameworks including MITRE ATT&CK, CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration), CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration), and CVE databases.

!!! note "Dynamic Code Analysis"
    Container-based sandbox environments with Neovim LSP integration provide safe, intelligent code examination and analysis.

!!! tip "Automated Reporting"
    Generates structured vulnerability reports with detailed exploitation procedures, risk assessments, and remediation guidance.

### What Makes IVExES Unique

- **AI-First Approach**: Built from the ground up to leverage large language models for security analysis
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allows easy integration of custom agents and analysis tools
- **Safe Execution**: Containerized environments ensure secure analysis of potentially malicious code
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Analyzes vulnerabilities from multiple perspectives using specialized knowledge bases

## Quick Start

Get started with IVExES in minutes:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/LetsDrinkSomeTea/ivexes.git
cd ivexes
make setup

# Configure API key
echo "LLM_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key" > .secrets.env

# Run analysis
python -c "
from ivexes.agents import SingleAgent
agent = SingleAgent()
await agent.run_interactive()
"
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md).
