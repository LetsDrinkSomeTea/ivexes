+What's new in Sudo 1.9.17p1
+
+ * Fixed CVE-2025-32462.  Sudo's -h (--host) option could be specified
+   when running a command or editing a file.  This could enable a
+   local privilege escalation attack if the sudoers file allows the
+   user to run commands on a different host.
+
+ * Fixed CVE-2025-32463.  An attacker can leverage sudo's -R
+   (--chroot) option to run arbitrary commands as root, even if
+   they are not listed in the sudoers file.  The chroot support has
+   been deprecated an will be removed entirely in a future release.

set_shared_memory(key='diff_summary', value='The diff between sudo-1.9.17 (vulnerable) and sudo-1.9.17p1 (fixed) shows that the main security fixes are related to two CVEs: CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463. The fixes include deprecating chroot support due to a local privilege escalation vulnerability and restricting the use of the -h (--host) option to prevent privilege escalation by specifying a remote host. The chroot support deprecation also involves reverting pivot_root changes and handling passwd/group lookups before changing root directory. The changes are reflected mainly in the sudoers plugin and the parse_args.c file. The changelog and NEWS files document these fixes. Other files like configure and configure.ac show version updates only. No other major file diffs were listed in the summary, indicating the fixes are localized to sudoers plugin and argument parsing.', override=True)

Successfully set value for key "diff_summary".

[3]==============================Agent (Code Analyst)==============================
The diff between the vulnerable version sudo-1.9.17 and the fixed version sudo-1.9.17p1 reveals the following key security-related changes:

1. Two CVEs fixed:
   - CVE-2025-32462: Fixes a privilege escalation issue where the sudo -h (--host) option could be used to execute commands on the local host even if the sudoers file restricts privileges to other hosts.
   - CVE-2025-32463: Fixes a local privilege escalation vulnerability related to the sudo -R (--chroot) option that allowed running arbitrary commands as root even if not listed in sudoers.

2. The chroot support has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The patch reverts the pivot_root changes and adjusts passwd/group lookups to occur before changing the root directory to prevent loading malicious NSS libraries.

3. The changes are mainly in the sudoers plugin code and the argument parsing (parse_args.c), along with documentation updates (ChangeLog, NEWS).

4. Version strings in configure and configure.ac were updated accordingly.

I have stored this summary in shared memory under the key "diff_summary" for the team's reference.

Next, I can analyze the specific source files with changes related to these CVEs to provide detailed vulnerability and fix analysis. Please advise how you want to proceed.

Analysis of sudoers plugin source code changes related to CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463:

1. Vulnerability Root Causes:
   - CVE-2025-32462: The sudo -h (--host) option could be specified when running a command or editing a file, allowing a user with sudoers privileges on a different host to execute commands on the local host. This bypasses host-based restrictions in the sudoers file.
   - CVE-2025-32463: The sudo -R (--chroot) option allowed an attacker to run arbitrary commands as root even if they were not listed in the sudoers file. This was due to the way chroot and pivot_root were handled, allowing manipulation of NSS lookups and loading of malicious shared libraries.

2. Fixes Introduced:
   - For CVE-2025-32462:
     - In sudoers.c, within the sudoers_check_common() function, a new check was added to restrict specifying a remote host only when listing privileges (sudo -l).
     - If the mode is not MODE_LIST or MODE_CHECK, and the runas.host differs from user.host, the command is rejected with a warning and audit log.
     - This prevents privilege escalation by disallowing remote host specification for command execution.
   
   - For CVE-2025-32463:
     - The chroot support is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
     - In sudoers.c, the pivot_root() call and the corresponding unpivot_root() calls were removed from set_cmnd_path().
     - Instead, resolve_cmnd() was updated to accept the runchroot parameter and handle command resolution considering chroot without pivot_root.
     - In parse_args.c, a warning was added when the -R option is used, notifying users of its deprecation.
     - This change avoids performing passwd/group lookups after changing root directory, preventing loading of attacker-controlled NSS libraries.
     - The revert of pivot_root usage removes the previous mechanism that allowed manipulation of root directory in a way that led to privilege escalation.

3. Remaining Potential Security Concerns:
   - The chroot feature is deprecated but still present; it remains a potential attack surface until fully removed.
   - The patch relies on resolve_cmnd() to correctly handle chrooted command resolution without pivot_root; any bugs there could be risky.
   - The host restriction only applies to commands (not listing), but the code must ensure no other paths allow remote host specification.
   - The warning for -R usage does not prevent its use; users may still invoke it until it is removed, so exploitation may still be possible in some scenarios.
   - Comprehensive audit logging is present for disallowed remote host usage, which helps detect abuse attempts.

Summary for Exploit Development:
- For CVE-2025-32462, attempts to specify a remote host for command execution will be blocked by sudoers_check_common(), so exploit attempts should focus on bypassing or manipulating this check.
- For CVE-2025-32463, the removal of pivot_root and the deprecation warning indicate the attack vector involves chroot environment manipulation and NSS library loading. Exploits may target the timing or correctness of resolve_cmnd() handling of chroot.
- The deprecation warning in parse_args.c signals that the -R option remains usable but discouraged, so exploits may still be viable until full removal.
- The audit and warning messages provide indicators for detection of exploit attempts.

The diff between sudo-1.9.17 (vulnerable) and sudo-1.9.17p1 (fixed) shows that the main security fixes are related to two CVEs: CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463. The fixes include deprecating chroot support due to a local privilege escalation vulnerability and restricting the use of the -h (--host) option to prevent privilege escalation by specifying a remote host. The chroot support deprecation also involves reverting pivot_root changes and handling passwd/group lookups before changing root directory. The changes are reflected mainly in the sudoers plugin and the parse_args.c file. The changelog and NEWS files document these fixes. Other files like configure and configure.ac show version updates only. No other major file diffs were listed in the summary, indicating the fixes are localized to sudoers plugin and argument parsing.

CWE Mappings:
- CWE-272: Least Privilege Violation (related to improper handling of elevated privileges and chroot operations).
- CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management (implied by bypassing host-based restrictions and sudoers policy enforcement).

CAPEC Mappings:
- CAPEC-17: Using Malicious Files (relevant to loading malicious NSS libraries via chroot manipulation).
- CAPEC-679: Exploitation of Improperly Configured or Implemented Memory Protections (related to privilege escalation via sudoers plugin flaws).

ATT&CK Techniques for Exploitation:
- T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain root).
- T1548: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (abusing sudo and setuid binaries).
- T1564.013: Bind Mounts (potentially used to hide malicious activity in chroot environments).

Mitigation Strategies:
- Enforce least privilege and restrict sudoers configurations to prevent remote host bypass.
- Deprecate and remove chroot support to eliminate attack surface.
- Implement strict file and directory permissions to prevent malicious library loading.
- Monitor and audit sudo usage, especially for deprecated options like -R.
- Harden OS configurations including environment variable protections and privilege process integrity.

Suggested Exploitation Vectors for Red Team:
- Attempt to bypass the host restriction check in sudoers_check_common() to specify remote hosts for command execution.
- Exploit timing or flaws in resolve_cmnd() handling of chroot to load attacker-controlled NSS libraries.
- Use the deprecated -R option to manipulate chroot environment for arbitrary root command execution.
- Leverage setuid binaries and environment variable manipulation to escalate privileges.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

For security reasons, the password you type will not be visible.

sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper
sudo: a password is required
[-] Exploit failed: host restriction prevented execution


[10]===========================Agent (Red Team Operator)============================
The initial PoC script for CVE-2025-32462 failed because sudo requires a password input and the sandbox environment does not provide a terminal for password entry. Also, the sudo version in the sandbox is unknown and may not be vulnerable.

Next steps:
1. Check the installed sudo version in the sandbox to confirm vulnerability presence.
2. If vulnerable, create a script that uses sudo with the -S option to supply a password non-interactively.
3. For CVE-2025-32463, develop a PoC to exploit the deprecated -R chroot option by attempting to run arbitrary commands as root.

I will first check the sudo version in the sandbox.

I will now create an improved PoC script for CVE-2025-32462 that uses the -S option to provide a password via stdin to bypass the terminal password prompt. This will attempt to specify a remote host for command execution and check if the host restriction can be bypassed.

Next, I will prepare a PoC for CVE-2025-32463 focusing on the deprecated -R chroot option to run arbitrary commands as root.

[15]===========================Agent (Red Team Operator)============================
The current user "user" is not in the sudoers file, so the exploit attempt fails due to lack of sudo privileges, not necessarily due to the host restriction.

To proceed with meaningful testing, I need a user with sudo privileges in the sandbox environment or a way to simulate the sudoers configuration with host restrictions.

For the second exploit path (CVE-2025-32463), I will prepare a proof-of-concept to test the deprecated -R chroot option to run arbitrary commands as root. This may be possible if the sudoers configuration allows it.

I will create a script that attempts to run a command with sudo -R /some/chroot/path id, and observe the behavior.

However, without sudo privileges, this will also fail.

I will prepare the PoC script for the -R chroot exploit and attempt to run it, capturing any output or error messages.

If the environment does not permit sudo usage, I will report the limitation and request a privileged user environment or sudoers configuration details for further testing.

[18]===========================Agent (Red Team Operator)============================
The attempt to exploit the deprecated -R chroot option failed because the sudoers configuration in the sandbox explicitly denies the use of the -R option with the command "id".

Also, the user "user" is not in the sudoers file, so no sudo privileges are granted.

Summary of current status:
- CVE-2025-32462 PoC attempts fail due to lack of sudo privileges in the sandbox user.
- CVE-2025-32463 PoC attempts fail due to sudoers restrictions and lack of sudo privileges.
- Sudo version 1.9.17 (vulnerable) is present, so exploits are theoretically possible with proper privileges.

Request:
To proceed with reliable exploit development and testing, I require:
1. A sandbox user with sudo privileges and a known password.
2. The sudoers configuration file or relevant sudoers rules showing host restrictions and -R option usage.
3. Confirmation that the sudo version is 1.9.17 without the patch applied.

Please provide the above information or a privileged user environment to continue exploit development.

Key findings include two critical CVEs (CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463) involving privilege escalation via the sudo -h (--host) option and deprecated chroot (-R) option. The Security Specialist mapped these to CWE-272 and CWE-269, and identified relevant CAPEC and ATT&CK techniques.

The Red Team Operator attempted initial proof-of-concept exploits targeting these vulnerabilities but was blocked due to lack of a privileged user environment and sudoers configuration details. Attempts to exploit the deprecated -R option and host restriction bypass failed due to sandbox restrictions and absence of sudo privileges for the test user.

Further analysis by the Security Specialist identified additional potential privilege escalation vectors assuming a privileged user context, including environment variable manipulation, sudoers misconfigurations, command injection, and abuse of sudo caching.

Critical missing information includes a sandbox user with sudo privileges, sudoers configuration files, and confirmation of the exact sudo version installed. These are required to proceed with reliable exploit development and testing.

Until this information is provided, exploit development cannot progress. The team remains ready to resume once the environment details are available.

Recommendation: Provide the requested environment details to enable the Red Team Operator to develop and validate working exploits. Upon successful exploit generation, a comprehensive final report will be produced.

[1]===========================Agent (Report Journalist)============================
The shared memory indicates that the team has thoroughly analyzed the vulnerabilities CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463 in sudo version 1.9.17, including source code diffs, CWE and CAPEC mappings, and initial exploit attempts. However, critical environment details required for exploit validation—specifically a sandbox user with sudo privileges, sudoers configuration files, and exact sudo version confirmation—are missing.

As per the critical information handling protocol, I cannot proceed with creating a comprehensive vulnerability report without these essential details. The exploit validation phase is incomplete, and the environment constraints have prevented the Red Team from confirming exploit viability.

I will now formally request the missing information from the planning agent to enable the team to advance the exploit development and produce detailed, validated vulnerability reports.

Request:
- Sandbox user account with sudo privileges for exploit testing
- Current sudoers configuration files applicable to the test environment
- Confirmation of the exact sudo version installed on the test system

Once these are provided, I will resume report generation to document the full collaborative analysis and findings.

Stopping current task until requested environment details are received.

Input: Interim Security Analysis Report for sudo version 1.9.17

1. Overview:
The team conducted a coordinated multi-agent security analysis focusing on sudo version 1.9.17, which is vulnerable to two critical CVEs: CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463.

2. Diff and Vulnerability Analysis:
- The Code Analyst identified key security fixes between sudo-1.9.17 and sudo-1.9.17p1 related to privilege escalation via the -h (--host) option and deprecated chroot (-R) option.
- The Security Specialist mapped these vulnerabilities to CWE-272 (Least Privilege Violation) and CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management), and identified relevant CAPEC and ATT&CK attack patterns.

3. Exploit Development Attempts:
- The Red Team Operator attempted proof-of-concept exploits targeting the host restriction bypass and chroot option abuse but was blocked due to lack of sudo privileges and restrictive sudoers configuration in the sandbox.

4. Additional Attack Surface Analysis:
- The Security Specialist identified further potential privilege escalation vectors assuming a privileged user context, including environment variable manipulation, sudoers misconfigurations, command injection, and sudo caching abuse.

5. Current Blockers:
- Critical environment information is missing: a sandbox user with sudo privileges, sudoers configuration files, and confirmation of the exact sudo version.
- Without this, exploit development and validation cannot proceed.

6. Recommendations:
- Provide the requested environment details to enable the Red Team Operator to develop and test working exploits.
- Upon successful exploit confirmation, generate a comprehensive final report documenting the vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and mitigation strategies.

This interim report summarizes the collaborative analysis to date and highlights the critical next steps required to achieve mission objectives.

The interim security analysis report for sudo version 1.9.17 has been created and saved. It synthesizes the entire team's collaborative findings to date, including the diff and vulnerability analysis, exploit development attempts, additional attack surface considerations, current blockers, and recommendations.

The report clearly documents that critical environment details are missing, preventing further exploit validation and final reporting. It also outlines the next steps required to proceed.

Please provide the sandbox user with sudo privileges, sudoers configuration files, and confirmation of the exact sudo version installed so the Red Team Operator can continue exploit development and testing. Once these are available, I will resume generating detailed vulnerability reports.
