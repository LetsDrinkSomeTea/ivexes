The diff between the vulnerable version sudo-1.9.17 and the fixed version sudo-1.9.17p1 reveals the following key security-related changes:

1. Two CVEs fixed:
   - CVE-2025-32462: Fixes a privilege escalation issue where the sudo -h (--host) option could be used to execute commands on the local host even if the sudoers file restricts privileges to other hosts.
   - CVE-2025-32463: Fixes a local privilege escalation vulnerability related to the sudo -R (--chroot) option that allowed running arbitrary commands as root even if not listed in sudoers.

2. The chroot support has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The patch reverts the pivot_root changes and adjusts passwd/group lookups to occur before changing the root directory to prevent loading malicious NSS libraries.

3. The changes are mainly in the sudoers plugin code and the argument parsing (parse_args.c), along with documentation updates (ChangeLog, NEWS).

4. Version strings in configure and configure.ac were updated accordingly.

I have stored this summary in shared memory under the key "diff_summary" for the team's reference.

[18:55:04]
Analysis of sudoers plugin source code changes related to CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463:

1. Vulnerability Root Causes:
   - CVE-2025-32462: The sudo -h (--host) option could be specified when running a command or editing a file, allowing a user with sudoers privileges on a different host to execute commands on the local host. This bypasses host-based restrictions in the sudoers file.
   - CVE-2025-32463: The sudo -R (--chroot) option allowed an attacker to run arbitrary commands as root even if they were not listed in the sudoers file. This was due to the way chroot and pivot_root were handled, allowing manipulation of NSS lookups and loading of malicious shared libraries.

2. Fixes Introduced:
   - For CVE-2025-32462:
     - In sudoers.c, within the sudoers_check_common() function, a new check was added to restrict specifying a remote host only when listing privileges (sudo -l).
     - If the mode is not MODE_LIST or MODE_CHECK, and the runas.host differs from user.host, the command is rejected with a warning and audit log.
     - This prevents privilege escalation by disallowing remote host specification for command execution.
   
   - For CVE-2025-32463:
     - The chroot support is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
     - In sudoers.c, the pivot_root() call and the corresponding unpivot_root() calls were removed from set_cmnd_path().
     - Instead, resolve_cmnd() was updated to accept the runchroot parameter and handle command resolution considering chroot without pivot_root.
     - In parse_args.c, a warning was added when the -R option is used, notifying users of its deprecation.
     - This change avoids performing passwd/group lookups after changing root directory, preventing loading of attacker-controlled NSS libraries.
     - The revert of pivot_root usage removes the previous mechanism that allowed manipulation of root directory in a way that led to privilege escalation.

3. Remaining Potential Security Concerns:
   - The chroot feature is deprecated but still present; it remains a potential attack surface until fully removed.
   - The patch relies on resolve_cmnd() to correctly handle chrooted command resolution without pivot_root; any bugs there could be risky.
   - The host restriction only applies to commands (not listing), but the code must ensure no other paths allow remote host specification.
   - The warning for -R usage does not prevent its use; users may still invoke it until it is removed, so exploitation may still be possible in some scenarios.
   - Comprehensive audit logging is present for disallowed remote host usage, which helps detect abuse attempts.

Summary for Exploit Development:
- For CVE-2025-32462, attempts to specify a remote host for command execution will be blocked by sudoers_check_common(), so exploit attempts should focus on bypassing or manipulating this check.
- For CVE-2025-32463, the removal of pivot_root and the deprecation warning indicate the attack vector involves chroot environment manipulation and NSS library loading. Exploits may target the timing or correctness of resolve_cmnd() handling of chroot.
- The deprecation warning in parse_args.c signals that the -R option remains usable but discouraged, so exploits may still be viable until full removal.
- The audit and warning messages provide indicators for detection of exploit attempts.

T1036.011 Overwrite Process Arguments:
<Description>: Adversaries may modify a process's in-memory arguments to change its name in order to appear as a legitimate or benign process. On Linux, the operating system stores command-line arguments in the process’s stack and passes them to the `main()` function as the `argv` array. The first element, `argv[0]`, typically contains the process name or path - by default, the command used to actually start the process (e.g., `cat /etc/passwd`). By default, the Linux `/proc` filesystem uses this value to represent the process name. The `/proc/<PID>/cmdline` file reflects the contents of this memory, and tools like `ps` use it to display process information. Since arguments are stored in user-space memory at launch, this modification can be performed without elevated privileges. 

During runtime, adversaries can erase the memory used by all command-line arguments for a process, overwriting each argument string with null bytes. This removes evidence of how the process was originally launched. They can then write a spoofed string into the memory region previously occupied by `argv[0]` to mimic a benign command, such as `cat resolv.conf`. The new command-line string is reflected in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline` and displayed by tools like `ps`.(Citation: Sandfly BPFDoor 2022)(Citation: Microsoft XorDdos Linux Stealth 2022)  </Description>

<ATT&CK-TECHNIQUE>
T1548.001 Setuid and Setgid:
<Description>: An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively.(Citation: setuid man page) Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.

Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications (i.e. [Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/002)). The <code>chmod</code> command can set these bits with bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>. This will enable the setuid bit. To enable the setgid bit, <code>chmod 2775</code> and <code>chmod g+s</code> can be used.

Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware) This abuse is often part of a "shell escape" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions.

Alternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled (i.e. [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)). The setuid and setguid bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>find</code> command can also be used to search for such files. For example, <code>find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/null</code> can be used to find files with setuid set and <code>find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null</code> may be used for setgid. Binaries that have these bits set may then be abused by adversaries.(Citation: GTFOBins Suid) </Description>

T1068 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:
<Description>: Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.

When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.

Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode. This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020) Adversaries may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or download it to a compromised system via [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) or [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570). </Description>

T1548 Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:
<Description>: Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk.(Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)(Citation: sudo man page 2018) An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware)(Citation: Fortinet Fareit) </Description>

</ATT&CK-TECHNIQUE>


<ATT&CK-TECHNIQUE>
T1564.013 Bind Mounts:
<Description>: Adversaries may abuse bind mounts on file structures to hide their activity and artifacts from native utilities. A bind mount maps a directory or file from one location on the filesystem to another, similar to a shortcut on Windows. It’s commonly used to provide access to specific files or directories across different environments, such as inside containers or chroot environments, and requires sudo access. 

Adversaries may use bind mounts to map either an empty directory or a benign `/proc` directory to a malicious process’s `/proc` directory. Using the commands `mount –o bind /proc/benign-process /proc/malicious-process` (or `mount –B`), the malicious process's `/proc` directory is overlayed with the contents of a benign process's `/proc` directory. When system utilities query process activity, such as `ps` and `top`, the kernel follows the bind mount and presents the benign directory’s contents instead of the malicious process's actual `/proc` directory. As a result, these utilities display information that appears to come from the benign process, effectively hiding the malicious process's metadata, executable, or other artifacts from detection.(Citation: Cado Security Commando Cat 2024)(Citation: Ahn Lab CoinMiner 2023) </Description>

M1039 Environment Variable Permissions:
<Description>: Restrict the modification of environment variables to authorized users and processes by enforcing strict permissions and policies. This ensures the integrity of environment variables, preventing adversaries from abusing or altering them for malicious purposes. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:

Restrict Write Access:

- Use Case: Set file system-level permissions to restrict access to environment variable configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, `systemd` service files).
- Implementation: Configure `/etc/environment` or `/etc/profile` on Linux systems to only allow root or administrators to modify the file.

Secure Access Controls:

- Use Case: Limit access to environment variable settings in application deployment tools or CI/CD pipelines to authorized personnel.
- Implementation: Use role-based access control (RBAC) in tools like Jenkins or GitLab to ensure only specific users can modify environment variables.

Restrict Process Scope:

- Use Case: Configure policies to ensure environment variables are only accessible to the processes they are explicitly intended for.
- Implementation: Use containerized environments like Docker to isolate environment variables to specific containers and ensure they are not inherited by other processes.

Audit Environment Variable Changes:

- Use Case: Enable logging for changes to critical environment variables.
- Implementation: Use `auditd` on Linux to monitor changes to files like `/etc/environment` or application-specific environment files. </Description>

<ATT&CK-MITIGATION>
M1022 Restrict File and Directory Permissions:
<Description>: Restricting file and directory permissions involves setting access controls at the file system level to limit which users, groups, or processes can read, write, or execute files. By configuring permissions appropriately, organizations can reduce the attack surface for adversaries seeking to access sensitive data, plant malicious code, or tamper with system files.

Enforce Least Privilege Permissions:

- Remove unnecessary write permissions on sensitive files and directories.
- Use file ownership and groups to control access for specific roles.

Example (Windows): Right-click the shared folder → Properties → Security tab → Adjust permissions for NTFS ACLs.

Harden File Shares:

- Disable anonymous access to shared folders.
- Enforce NTFS permissions for shared folders on Windows.

Example: Set permissions to restrict write access to critical files, such as system executables (e.g., `/bin` or `/sbin` on Linux). Use tools like `chown` and `chmod` to assign file ownership and limit access.

On Linux, apply:
`chmod 750 /etc/sensitive.conf`
`chown root:admin /etc/sensitive.conf`

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):

- Use tools like Tripwire, Wazuh, or OSSEC to monitor changes to critical file permissions.

Audit File System Access:

- Enable auditing to track permission changes or unauthorized access attempts.
- Use auditd (Linux) or Event Viewer (Windows) to log activities.

Restrict Startup Directories:

- Configure permissions to prevent unauthorized writes to directories like `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`.

Example: Restrict write access to critical directories like `/etc/`, `/usr/local/`, and Windows directories such as `C:\Windows\System32`.

- On Windows, use icacls to modify permissions: `icacls "C:\Windows\System32" /inheritance:r /grant:r SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F`
- On Linux, monitor permissions using tools like `lsattr` or `auditd`. </Description>

M1025 Privileged Process Integrity:
<Description>: Privileged Process Integrity focuses on defending highly privileged processes (e.g., system services, antivirus, or authentication processes) from tampering, injection, or compromise by adversaries. These processes often interact with critical components, making them prime targets for techniques like code injection, privilege escalation, and process manipulation. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:

Protected Process Mechanisms:

- Enable RunAsPPL on Windows systems to protect LSASS and other critical processes.
- Use registry modifications to enforce protected process settings: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RunAsPPL`

Anti-Injection and Memory Protection:

- Enable Control Flow Guard (CFG), DEP, and ASLR to protect against process memory tampering.
- Deploy endpoint protection tools that actively block process injection attempts.

Code Signing Validation:

- Implement policies for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) or AppLocker to enforce execution of signed binaries.
- Ensure critical processes are signed with valid certificates.

Access Controls:

- Use DACLs and MIC to limit which users and processes can interact with privileged processes.
- Disable unnecessary debugging capabilities for high-privileged processes.

Kernel-Level Protections:

- Ensure Kernel Patch Protection (PatchGuard) is enabled on Windows systems.
- Leverage SELinux or AppArmor on Linux to enforce kernel-level security policies.

M1035 Limit Access to Resource Over Network:
<Description>: Restrict access to network resources, such as file shares, remote systems, and services, to only those users, accounts, or systems with a legitimate business requirement. This can include employing technologies like network concentrators, RDP gateways, and zero-trust network access (ZTNA) models, alongside hardening services and protocols. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:

Audit and Restrict Access:

- Regularly audit permissions for file shares, network services, and remote access tools.
- Remove unnecessary access and enforce least privilege principles for users and services.
- Use Active Directory and IAM tools to restrict access based on roles and attributes.

Deploy Secure Remote Access Solutions:

- Use RDP gateways, VPN concentrators, and ZTNA solutions to aggregate and secure remote access connections.
- Configure access controls to restrict connections based on time, device, and user identity.
- Enforce MFA for all remote access mechanisms.

Disable Unnecessary Services:

- Identify running services using tools like netstat (Windows/Linux) or Nmap.
- Disable unused services, such as Telnet, FTP, and legacy SMB, to reduce the attack surface.
- Use firewall rules to block traffic on unused ports and protocols.

Network Segmentation and Isolation:

- Use VLANs, firewalls, or micro-segmentation to isolate critical network resources from general access.
- Restrict communication between subnets to prevent lateral movement.

Monitor and Log Access:

- Monitor access attempts to file shares, RDP, and remote network resources using SIEM tools.
- Enable auditing and logging for successful and failed attempts to access restricted resources.

*Tools for Implementation*

File Share Management:

- Microsoft Active Directory Group Policies
- Samba (Linux/Unix file share management)
- AccessEnum (Windows access auditing tool)

Secure Remote Access:

- Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway
- Apache Guacamole (open-source RDP/VNC gateway)
- Zero Trust solutions: Tailscale, Cloudflare Zero Trust

Service and Protocol Hardening:

- Nmap or Nessus for network service discovery
- Windows Group Policy Editor for disabling SMBv1, Telnet, and legacy protocols
- iptables or firewalld (Linux) for blocking unnecessary traffic

The attempt to exploit the deprecated -R chroot option failed because the sudoers configuration in the sandbox explicitly denies the use of the -R option with the command "id".

Also, the user "user" is not in the sudoers file, so no sudo privileges are granted.

Summary of current status:
- CVE-2025-32462 PoC attempts fail due to lack of sudo privileges in the sandbox user.
- CVE-2025-32463 PoC attempts fail due to sudoers restrictions and lack of sudo privileges.

Analysis of sudoers plugin source code changes related to CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463:

1. Vulnerability Root Causes:
   - CVE-2025-32462: The sudo -h (--host) option could be specified when running a command or editing a file, allowing a user with sudoers privileges on a different host to execute commands on the local host. This bypasses host-based restrictions in the sudoers file.
   - CVE-2025-32463: The sudo -R (--chroot) option allowed an attacker to run arbitrary commands as root even if they were not listed in the sudoers file. This was due to the way chroot and pivot_root were handled, allowing manipulation of NSS lookups and loading of malicious shared libraries.

2. Fixes Introduced:
   - For CVE-2025-32462:
     - In sudoers.c, within the sudoers_check_common() function, a new check was added to restrict specifying a remote host only when listing privileges (sudo -l).
     - If the mode is not MODE_LIST or MODE_CHECK, and the runas.host differs from user.host, the command is rejected with a warning and audit log.
     - This prevents privilege escalation by disallowing remote host specification for command execution.
   
   - For CVE-2025-32463:
     - The chroot support is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
     - In sudoers.c, the pivot_root() call and the corresponding unpivot_root() calls were removed from set_cmnd_path().
     - Instead, resolve_cmnd() was updated to accept the runchroot parameter and handle command resolution considering chroot without pivot_root.
     - In parse_args.c, a warning was added when the -R option is used, notifying users of its deprecation.
     - This change avoids performing passwd/group lookups after changing root directory, preventing loading of attacker-controlled NSS libraries.
     - The revert of pivot_root usage removes the previous mechanism that allowed manipulation of root directory in a way that led to privilege escalation.

3. Remaining Potential Security Concerns:
   - The chroot feature is deprecated but still present; it remains a potential attack surface until fully removed.
   - The patch relies on resolve_cmnd() to correctly handle chrooted command resolution without pivot_root; any bugs there could be risky.
   - The host restriction only applies to commands (not listing), but the code must ensure no other paths allow remote host specification.
   - The warning for -R usage does not prevent its use; users may still invoke it until it is removed, so exploitation may still be possible in some scenarios.
   - Comprehensive audit logging is present for disallowed remote host usage, which helps detect abuse attempts.

Summary for Exploit Development:
- For CVE-2025-32462, attempts to specify a remote host for command execution will be blocked by sudoers_check_common(), so exploit attempts should focus on bypassing or manipulating this check.
- For CVE-2025-32463, the removal of pivot_root and the deprecation warning indicate the attack vector involves chroot environment manipulation and NSS library loading. Exploits may target the timing or correctness of resolve_cmnd() handling of chroot.
- The deprecation warning in parse_args.c signals that the -R option remains usable but discouraged, so exploits may still be viable until full removal.
- The audit and warning messages provide indicators for detection of exploit attempts.

<ATT&CK-TECHNIQUE>
T1548.003 Sudo and Sudo Caching:
<Description>: Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.

Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as "superuser do") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The <code>sudo</code> command "allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."(Citation: sudo man page 2018) Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code>, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).

The sudoers file, <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like <code>user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</code>.(Citation: OSX.Dok Malware) Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.

Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For example, <code>/var/db/sudo</code>'s timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> range. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. Additional, if <code>tty_tickets</code> is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.

In the wild, malware has disabled <code>tty_tickets</code> to potentially make scripting easier by issuing <code>echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers</code>.(Citation: cybereason osx proton) In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued <code>killall Terminal</code>. As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has <code>tty_tickets</code> enabled by default. </Description>

<ATT&CK-TECHNIQUE>
T1548.001 Setuid and Setgid:
<Description>: An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively.(Citation: setuid man page) Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.

Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications (i.e. [Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/002)). The <code>chmod</code> command can set these bits with bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>. This will enable the setuid bit. To enable the setgid bit, <code>chmod 2775</code> and <code>chmod g+s</code> can be used.

Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware) This abuse is often part of a "shell escape" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions.

Alternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled (i.e. [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)). The setuid and setguid bits are indicated with an "s" instead of an "x" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>find</code> command can also be used to search for such files. For example, <code>find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/null</code> can be used to find files with setuid set and <code>find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null</code> may be used for setgid. Binaries that have these bits set may then be abused by adversaries.(Citation: GTFOBins Suid) </Description>

CAPEC-10 Buffer Overflow via Environment Variables:
<Description>: This attack pattern involves causing a buffer overflow through manipulation of environment variables. Once the adversary finds that they can modify an environment variable, they may try to overflow associated buffers. This attack leverages implicit trust often placed in environment variables. </Description>
<Prerequisites>: The application uses environment variables. | An environment variable exposed to the user is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. | The vulnerable environment variable uses untrusted data. | Tainted data used in the environment variables is not properly validated. For instance boundary checking is not done before copying the input data to a buffer. </Prerequisites>
</CAPEC>


<ATT&CK-TECHNIQUE>
T1546.004 Unix Shell Configuration Modification:
<Description>: Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. User [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)s execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (<code>/etc</code>) and the user’s home directory (<code>~/</code>) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately. 

Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the <code>/etc/profile</code> and <code>/etc/profile.d</code> files.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)(Citation: bencane blog bashrc) These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches. For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_login</code>, or <code>~/.profile</code> which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely.(Citation: anomali-rocke-tactics)(Citation: Linux manual bash invocation) Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used <code>~/.bash_profile</code> to ensure execution. Adversaries have also leveraged the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line interface.(Citation: Tsunami)(Citation: anomali-rocke-tactics)(Citation: anomali-linux-rabbit)(Citation: Magento) Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use the <code>~/.bash_logout</code> file to execute malicious commands at the end of a session. 

For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+. When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell. The login shell configures the system environment using <code>/etc/profile</code>, <code>/etc/zshenv</code>, <code>/etc/zprofile</code>, and <code>/etc/zlogin</code>.(Citation: ScriptingOSX zsh)(Citation: PersistentJXA_leopitt)(Citation: code_persistence_zsh)(Citation: macOS MS office sandbox escape) The login shell then configures the user environment with <code>~/.zprofile</code> and <code>~/.zlogin</code>. The interactive shell uses the <code>~/.zshrc</code> to configure the user environment. Upon exiting, <code>/etc/zlogout</code> and <code>~/.zlogout</code> are executed. For legacy programs, macOS executes <code>/etc/bashrc</code> on startup. </Description>

T1548 Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:
<Description>: Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk.(Citation: TechNet How UAC Works)(Citation: sudo man page 2018) An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware)(Citation: Fortinet Fareit) </Description>

<ATT&CK-TECHNIQUE>
T1068 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:
<Description>: Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.

When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.

Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode. This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020) Adversaries may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or download it to a compromised system via [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) or [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570). </Description>

For sudo version 1.9.17, assuming a user with sudo privileges is available, here is an analysis of potential overlooked or less obvious privilege escalation vectors and attack techniques beyond the known CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463 vulnerabilities:

1. **Environment Variable Manipulation:**
   - Attackers can exploit environment variables that influence sudo or commands run via sudo, such as `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, or `PATH`, to load malicious libraries or binaries.
   - CAPEC-10 (Buffer Overflow via Environment Variables) is relevant if sudo or invoked commands improperly validate environment inputs.
   - Mitigation includes sanitizing environment variables and restricting which variables are preserved by sudo (`env_reset` and `env_keep` sudoers options).

2. **Sudoers Misconfigurations:**
   - Misconfigured sudoers entries, such as `NOPASSWD: ALL` or overly permissive command allowances, can be abused to run unintended commands.
   - Abuse of sudo caching (`timestamp_timeout`) and disabling `tty_tickets` can allow privilege escalation without password prompts (ATT&CK T1548.003).
   - Attackers may modify the sudoers file if they have write access or exploit weak permissions on sudoers includes.
   - Privilege escalation can also occur by abusing sudoers entries that allow running commands with shell escapes or command injection vectors.

3. **Command Injection Possibilities:**
   - If sudoers allows running commands that accept user input or environment variables without proper sanitization, attackers can inject shell commands.
   - Exploiting commands with setuid or setgid bits (ATT&CK T1548.001) can provide privilege escalation paths.
   - Attackers can abuse shell configuration files (`~/.bashrc`, `/etc/profile`, etc.) to persist or escalate privileges (ATT&CK T1546.004).

4. **Other Considerations:**
   - Abuse of sudo caching and timestamp files to execute sudo commands without re-authentication.
   - Exploiting sudo plugins or extensions that may have vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
   - Leveraging bind mounts or chroot environments to hide malicious activity or escalate privileges.

**Summary for Red Team Exploit Development:**
- Test environment variable manipulation to influence sudo or commands it runs.
- Review sudoers configuration for overly permissive or dangerous entries.
- Attempt command injection via allowed sudo commands or shell escapes.
- Exploit sudo caching and disabled tty_tickets to bypass password prompts.
- Investigate setuid/setgid binaries and shell startup files for privilege escalation.

This analysis prepares the team to rapidly iterate exploits once privileged user context is provided, focusing on these less obvious but impactful attack surfaces. Let me know if you want me to map these findings to CWE, CAPEC, and ATT&CK frameworks or suggest mitigations.

- Review sudoers configuration for overly permissive or dangerous entries.
- Attempt command injection via allowed sudo commands or shell escapes.
- Exploit sudo caching and disabled tty_tickets to bypass password prompts.
- Investigate setuid/setgid binaries and shell startup files for privilege escalation.

This analysis prepares the team to rapidly iterate exploits once privileged user context is provided, focusing on these less obvious but impactful attack surfaces. Let me know if you want me to map these findings to CWE, CAPEC, and ATT&CK frameworks or suggest mitigations.

[10]=============================Agent (Planning Agent)=============================
I have coordinated the initial diff analysis and vulnerability assessment with the Code Analyst and Security Specialist. The Red Team Operator attempted exploit development but requires privileged user environment details and sudoers configuration to proceed.

I have requested these details from the environment. Meanwhile, the Security Specialist has prepared an analysis of overlooked privilege escalation vectors assuming a privileged user context to enable rapid exploit iteration once the needed information is available.

Next steps:
1. Await privileged user info, sudoers config, and sudo version confirmation.
2. Relay this info to the Red Team Operator to resume exploit development.
3. If needed, direct the Red Team Operator to test environment variable manipulation, sudoers misconfigurations, and command injection vectors.
4. Once a working exploit is developed and validated, coordinate with the Report Journalist for final documentation.

I will continue monitoring for the required environment information and coordinate the team accordingly.
Requesting from the environment:

Please provide the following to continue exploit development:
1. A sandbox user with sudo privileges and a known password.
2. The sudoers configuration file or relevant sudoers rules showing host restrictions and -R option usage.
3. Confirmation that the sudo version is 1.9.17 without the patch applied.

This information is critical to proceed with reliable proof-of-concept exploit development and testing.

diff_summary
[18:54:35]
The diff between sudo-1.9.17 (vulnerable) and sudo-1.9.17p1 (fixed) shows that the main security fixes are related to two CVEs: CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463. The fixes include deprecating chroot support due to a local privilege escalation vulnerability and restricting the use of the -h (--host) option to prevent privilege escalation by specifying a remote host. The chroot support deprecation also involves reverting pivot_root changes and handling passwd/group lookups before changing root directory. The changes are reflected mainly in the sudoers plugin and the parse_args.c file. The changelog and NEWS files document these fixes. Other files like configure and configure.ac show version updates only. No other major file diffs were listed in the summary, indicating the fixes are localized to sudoers plugin and argument parsing.


sudoers_plugin_cve_analysis
[18:55:04]
Analysis of sudoers plugin source code changes related to CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463:

1. Vulnerability Root Causes:
   - CVE-2025-32462: The sudo -h (--host) option could be specified when running a command or editing a file, allowing a user with sudoers privileges on a different host to execute commands on the local host. This bypasses host-based restrictions in the sudoers file.
   - CVE-2025-32463: The sudo -R (--chroot) option allowed an attacker to run arbitrary commands as root even if they were not listed in the sudoers file. This was due to the way chroot and pivot_root were handled, allowing manipulation of NSS lookups and loading of malicious shared libraries.

2. Fixes Introduced:
   - For CVE-2025-32462:
     - In sudoers.c, within the sudoers_check_common() function, a new check was added to restrict specifying a remote host only when listing privileges (sudo -l).
     - If the mode is not MODE_LIST or MODE_CHECK, and the runas.host differs from user.host, the command is rejected with a warning and audit log.
     - This prevents privilege escalation by disallowing remote host specification for command execution.
   
   - For CVE-2025-32463:
     - The chroot support is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
     - In sudoers.c, the pivot_root() call and the corresponding unpivot_root() calls were removed from set_cmnd_path().
     - Instead, resolve_cmnd() was updated to accept the runchroot parameter and handle command resolution considering chroot without pivot_root.
     - In parse_args.c, a warning was added when the -R option is used, notifying users of its deprecation.
     - This change avoids performing passwd/group lookups after changing root directory, preventing loading of attacker-controlled NSS libraries.
     - The revert of pivot_root usage removes the previous mechanism that allowed manipulation of root directory in a way that led to privilege escalation.

3. Remaining Potential Security Concerns:
   - The chroot feature is deprecated but still present; it remains a potential attack surface until fully removed.
   - The patch relies on resolve_cmnd() to correctly handle chrooted command resolution without pivot_root; any bugs there could be risky.
   - The host restriction only applies to commands (not listing), but the code must ensure no other paths allow remote host specification.
   - The warning for -R usage does not prevent its use; users may still invoke it until it is removed, so exploitation may still be possible in some scenarios.
   - Comprehensive audit logging is present for disallowed remote host usage, which helps detect abuse attempts.

Summary for Exploit Development:
- For CVE-2025-32462, attempts to specify a remote host for command execution will be blocked by sudoers_check_common(), so exploit attempts should focus on bypassing or manipulating this check.
- For CVE-2025-32463, the removal of pivot_root and the deprecation warning indicate the attack vector involves chroot environment manipulation and NSS library loading. Exploits may target the timing or correctness of resolve_cmnd() handling of chroot.
- The deprecation warning in parse_args.c signals that the -R option remains usable but discouraged, so exploits may still be viable until full removal.
- The audit and warning messages provide indicators for detection of exploit attempts.

diff_summary
[18:54:35]
The diff between sudo-1.9.17 (vulnerable) and sudo-1.9.17p1 (fixed) shows that the main security fixes are related to two CVEs: CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463. The fixes include deprecating chroot support due to a local privilege escalation vulnerability and restricting the use of the -h (--host) option to prevent privilege escalation by specifying a remote host. The chroot support deprecation also involves reverting pivot_root changes and handling passwd/group lookups before changing root directory. The changes are reflected mainly in the sudoers plugin and the parse_args.c file. The changelog and NEWS files document these fixes. Other files like configure and configure.ac show version updates only. No other major file diffs were listed in the summary, indicating the fixes are localized to sudoers plugin and argument parsing.

[18:55:04]
Analysis of sudoers plugin source code changes related to CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463:

1. Vulnerability Root Causes:
   - CVE-2025-32462: The sudo -h (--host) option could be specified when running a command or editing a file, allowing a user with sudoers privileges on a different host to execute commands on the local host. This bypasses host-based restrictions in the sudoers file.
   - CVE-2025-32463: The sudo -R (--chroot) option allowed an attacker to run arbitrary commands as root even if they were not listed in the sudoers file. This was due to the way chroot and pivot_root were handled, allowing manipulation of NSS lookups and loading of malicious shared libraries.

2. Fixes Introduced:
   - For CVE-2025-32462:
     - In sudoers.c, within the sudoers_check_common() function, a new check was added to restrict specifying a remote host only when listing privileges (sudo -l).
     - If the mode is not MODE_LIST or MODE_CHECK, and the runas.host differs from user.host, the command is rejected with a warning and audit log.
     - This prevents privilege escalation by disallowing remote host specification for command execution.
   
   - For CVE-2025-32463:
     - The chroot support is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
     - In sudoers.c, the pivot_root() call and the corresponding unpivot_root() calls were removed from set_cmnd_path().
     - Instead, resolve_cmnd() was updated to accept the runchroot parameter and handle command resolution considering chroot without pivot_root.
     - In parse_args.c, a warning was added when the -R option is used, notifying users of its deprecation.
     - This change avoids performing passwd/group lookups after changing root directory, preventing loading of attacker-controlled NSS libraries.
     - The revert of pivot_root usage removes the previous mechanism that allowed manipulation of root directory in a way that led to privilege escalation.

3. Remaining Potential Security Concerns:
   - The chroot feature is deprecated but still present; it remains a potential attack surface until fully removed.
   - The patch relies on resolve_cmnd() to correctly handle chrooted command resolution without pivot_root; any bugs there could be risky.
   - The host restriction only applies to commands (not listing), but the code must ensure no other paths allow remote host specification.
   - The warning for -R usage does not prevent its use; users may still invoke it until it is removed, so exploitation may still be possible in some scenarios.
   - Comprehensive audit logging is present for disallowed remote host usage, which helps detect abuse attempts.

Summary for Exploit Development:
- For CVE-2025-32462, attempts to specify a remote host for command execution will be blocked by sudoers_check_common(), so exploit attempts should focus on bypassing or manipulating this check.
- For CVE-2025-32463, the removal of pivot_root and the deprecation warning indicate the attack vector involves chroot environment manipulation and NSS library loading. Exploits may target the timing or correctness of resolve_cmnd() handling of chroot.
- The deprecation warning in parse_args.c signals that the -R option remains usable but discouraged, so exploits may still be viable until full removal.
- The audit and warning messages provide indicators for detection of exploit attempts.

CVE-2025-32462_32463_CWE_CAPEC_ATTACK_MITIGATION
[18:55:22]
CWE Mappings:
- CWE-272: Least Privilege Violation (related to improper handling of elevated privileges and chroot operations).
- CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management (implied by bypassing host-based restrictions and sudoers policy enforcement).

CAPEC Mappings:
- CAPEC-17: Using Malicious Files (relevant to loading malicious NSS libraries via chroot manipulation).
- CAPEC-679: Exploitation of Improperly Configured or Implemented Memory Protections (related to privilege escalation via sudoers plugin flaws).

ATT&CK Techniques for Exploitation:
- T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain root).
- T1548: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (abusing sudo and setuid binaries).
- T1564.013: Bind Mounts (potentially used to hide malicious activity in chroot environments).

Mitigation Strategies:
- Enforce least privilege and restrict sudoers configurations to prevent remote host bypass.
- Deprecate and remove chroot support to eliminate attack surface.
- Implement strict file and directory permissions to prevent malicious library loading.
- Monitor and audit sudo usage, especially for deprecated options like -R.
- Harden OS configurations including environment variable protections and privilege process integrity.

Suggested Exploitation Vectors for Red Team:
- Attempt to bypass the host restriction check in sudoers_check_common() to specify remote hosts for command execution.
- Exploit timing or flaws in resolve_cmnd() handling of chroot to load attacker-controlled NSS libraries.
- Use the deprecated -R option to manipulate chroot environment for arbitrary root command execution.
- Leverage setuid binaries and environment variable manipulation to escalate privileges.
