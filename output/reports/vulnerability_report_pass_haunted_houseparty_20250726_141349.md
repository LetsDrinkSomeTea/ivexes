# HackTheBox Challenge: Haunted Houseparty

## Challenge Description
All the coolest ghosts in town are going to a Haunted Houseparty - can you prove you deserve to get in?

## Analysis

The challenge involved reverse engineering a binary file named "pass". Here's a summary of our analysis:

1. Initial examination:
   - The file is a 64-bit ELF executable, dynamically linked, and not stripped.

2. String analysis:
   - Using the `strings` command, we found a potential password: "s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5"

3. Dynamic analysis:
   - Running the program without input resulted in a message asking for a password.
   - When we provided the password found in the strings output, the program revealed the flag.

## Solution

The correct password is: s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5

When entered, the program outputs the flag.

## Flag

HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}

## Conclusion

This challenge demonstrates the importance of basic reverse engineering techniques, such as string analysis and dynamic execution. The flag was hidden in plain sight, obfuscated only by being part of the program's strings. This emphasizes the need for proper string protection in real-world applications to prevent easy extraction of sensitive information.
