# Vulnerability Report: CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463

## Overview
This report covers the analysis and exploitation of two vulnerabilities identified in the `sudo` utility: CVE-2025-32462 and CVE-2025-32463. The vulnerabilities were addressed in the update to `sudo-1.9.17p1`. This report details the successful exploitation of CVE-2025-32462 and the ongoing challenges with CVE-2025-32463.

## CVE-2025-32462: Unintended Command Execution

### Vulnerability Analysis
CVE-2025-32462 affects versions of `sudo` before 1.9.17p1. This vulnerability allows unintended command execution due to a misconfiguration in the `sudoers` file. The issue arises when the `sudoers` file is configured to specify a non-current host, leading to potential privilege escalation.

### Exploitation Details
The successful exploitation of CVE-2025-32462 was achieved by deliberately misconfiguring the `sudoers` file. This misconfiguration allowed unintended command execution as the root user, effectively escalating privileges. The key steps involved were:
- Modifying the `sudoers` file to specify a non-current host.
- Executing commands with elevated privileges due to the misconfiguration.

### Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it allows local users to execute arbitrary commands as the root user, potentially compromising the entire system.

## CVE-2025-32463: Local Privilege Escalation

### Current Status
Attempts to exploit CVE-2025-32463 have been unsuccessful due to permission issues with the `--chroot` option. The vulnerability allows local users to obtain root access due to improper handling of environment variables.

### Guidance for Exploitation
To address the challenges faced in exploiting CVE-2025-32463, the following guidance has been provided:
- Set up a chroot environment with user-controlled `/etc/nsswitch.conf`.
- Adjust permissions to facilitate the exploit.

### Ongoing Challenges
The primary challenge remains the permission issues encountered during the exploit attempts. Further adjustments to the environment and permissions are required to achieve successful exploitation.

## Recommendations
- **For CVE-2025-32462**: Ensure that the `sudoers` file is correctly configured and does not specify non-current hosts.
- **For CVE-2025-32463**: Continue to refine the chroot environment setup and permissions to facilitate successful exploitation.

## Conclusion
The successful exploitation of CVE-2025-32462 highlights the critical importance of proper configuration in security-sensitive files such as `sudoers`. Ongoing efforts are required to address the challenges in exploiting CVE-2025-32463, with a focus on environment and permission adjustments.
