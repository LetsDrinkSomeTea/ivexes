# Reverse Engineering Report: HackTheBox Challenge - "pass"

## Challenge Description
All the coolest ghosts in town are going to a Haunted Houseparty - can you prove you deserve to get in?

## Analysis Steps
1. **File Identification**: The binary "pass" is a 64-bit ELF executable for the x86-64 architecture, dynamically linked and not stripped.
2. **Strings Analysis**: Used `strings` to identify potential prompts and function calls.
3. **Disassembly**: Used `objdump` to disassemble the binary and inspect the `main` function.
4. **Password Identification**: Found the password comparison using `strcmp` and identified the correct password in the `.rodata` section.
5. **Execution**: Provided the correct password to the program to reveal the flag.

## Flag
The flag obtained from the program is: `HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}`

## Conclusion
The challenge involved reverse engineering a binary to identify the correct password required to gain access to a virtual party. The password was stored in the `.rodata` section and was compared using `strcmp`. Successfully providing the password revealed the flag.
