# Reverse Engineering Analysis: behindthescenes

## Challenge Overview
The "behindthescenes" program is a HackTheBox challenge that implements anti-debugging techniques to make decompilation harder. The program uses illegal instruction exceptions and signal handlers to obfuscate its control flow.

## Technical Analysis

### Binary Information
- **File Type**: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64
- **Size**: 17,064 bytes
- **Architecture**: x86-64
- **Stripped**: No (symbols available)
- **Dynamic Libraries**: libc.so.6

### Anti-Debugging Techniques
The program employs a sophisticated anti-debugging technique:

1. **Signal Handler Setup**: The main function sets up a signal handler for SIGILL (signal 4) using `sigaction()`
2. **Illegal Instructions**: Throughout the code, `ud2` instructions are strategically placed
3. **Control Flow Obfuscation**: When a `ud2` instruction is executed, it triggers SIGILL, which is caught by the signal handler
4. **Instruction Pointer Manipulation**: The signal handler (`segill_sigaction`) modifies the instruction pointer (RIP) by adding 2 bytes to skip over the `ud2` instruction

### Program Logic
The program expects exactly one command-line argument (a password) and performs the following checks:

1. **Argument Count**: Verifies `argc == 2`
2. **Password Length**: Checks that the password is exactly 12 characters long
3. **Password Validation**: Compares the password in 4 segments of 3 characters each:
   - Characters 0-2: "Itz"
   - Characters 3-5: "_0n"
   - Characters 6-8: "Ly_"
   - Characters 9-11: "UD2"

### Key Functions
- `main()`: Entry point, sets up signal handler and performs password validation
- `segill_sigaction()`: Signal handler that skips over `ud2` instructions
- Standard library functions: `strncmp()`, `strlen()`, `printf()`, `puts()`

### String Analysis
Key strings found in the binary:
- `"./challenge <password>"` - Usage message
- `"> HTB{%s}\n"` - Flag output format
- `"Itz"`, `"_0n"`, `"Ly_"`, `"UD2"` - Password components

## Solution

### Password Discovery
Through static analysis using radare2, I identified the password validation logic:
- The program compares the input against hardcoded strings using `strncmp()`
- Each comparison checks 3 characters at specific offsets
- The complete password is: **Itz_0nLy_UD2**

### Flag Extraction
When the correct password is provided, the program outputs the flag in the format `> HTB{password}`.

**Flag**: `HTB{Itz_0nLy_UD2}`

## Tools Used
- **file**: Binary type identification
- **strings**: String extraction
- **radare2**: Disassembly and static analysis
- **Dynamic execution**: Password testing

## Key Insights
1. The challenge name "behindthescenes" refers to the hidden control flow using signal handlers
2. The password components cleverly reference the anti-debugging technique:
   - "Itz_0nLy_UD2" suggests "It's only UD2" (referring to the illegal instruction)
3. This demonstrates how signal handlers can be used to create non-linear program flow
4. The technique makes static analysis more challenging but not impossible

## Conclusion
This challenge effectively demonstrates advanced anti-debugging techniques while remaining solvable through careful static analysis. The use of SIGILL handlers and `ud2` instructions creates an interesting obfuscation method that requires understanding of both assembly language and Unix signal handling.
