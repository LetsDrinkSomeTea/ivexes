Title: GNU Screen < 4.5.1 — -L logfile symlink/permission vulnerability (CVE-2017-5618; primary class: CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link Following)

Executive Summary
- Scope: We evaluated a monorepo containing GNU Screen 4.5.0 (vulnerable) and 4.5.1 (patched) source trees and binaries. The focus was the -L logging option’s handling of a user-supplied logfile path.
- Major finding: In 4.5.0, option parsing for -L performs an early fopen("w") on the provided path before dropping privileges, enabling symlink-based file creation/truncation when screen is installed setuid root. Version 4.5.1 removes this behavior and defers secure logfile opening.
- Exploit outcome highlights: Our Red Team PoC (see shared key exploit_poc_script) and strace evidence (exploit_logs_vulnerable) captured openat(O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, …) on the attacker-controlled path following a symlink. In the patched build, no such open occurs during argument parsing (exploit_logs_patched). Sandbox policy blocked actual privileged overwrite, but the vulnerable open attempt was conclusively observed.
- Team synthesis: Code Analyst pinpointed the vulnerable code path (vulnerable_code_locations). Security Specialist mapped the issue (cve_mapping, cwe_classification, capec_mapping, attack_ttps). Red Team validated with PoC and runtime traces (exploit_poc_script, exploit_logs_*).

Technical Details
- Environment and targets
  - Repository layout (repo_map):
    - vulnerable-screen-4.5.0 (GNU Screen 4.5.0)
    - patched-screen-4.5.1 (GNU Screen 4.5.1)
  - Build commands (build_run_commands):
    - cd vulnerable-screen-4.5.0 && ./configure && make -j$(nproc)
    - cd patched-screen-4.5.1 && ./configure && make -j$(nproc)
  - Binaries (exploit_binaries):
    - System SUID: /usr/bin/screen — Screen version 4.05.00 (GNU) 10-Dec-16; setuid root
    - Built (non-suid): /home/user/src/vulnerable-screen-4.5.0/screen; /home/user/src/patched-screen-4.5.1/screen
  - Entry point (entry_points): screen.c:main(int ac, char **av); exercised via CLI options
- Root cause analysis
  - Vulnerable code (vulnerable_code_locations): In 4.5.0 screen.c option parsing case 'L', the path from -L is assigned and immediately "pre-checked" by calling fopen(path, "w") before dropping privileges. This can create/truncate files and follows symlinks with the process’s effective UID (root when setuid), crossing privilege boundaries.
  - Fixed behavior (diff_summary): 4.5.1 splits -L (enable logging) from -Logfile (set path), removes the early fopen from argument parsing, captures real/effective uid/gid earlier, and defers logfile operations to a secure reopen path (logreopen_register/lf_secreopen using secopen). No early write occurs.
- Affected and fixed versions
  - Affected: GNU Screen < 4.5.1 (cve_mapping)
  - Fixed: GNU Screen 4.5.1 (fixed_target)
- Attack surface and preconditions
  - Attack surface (attack_surfaces): CLI -L logfile path handling in screen.c; symlink/hardlink manipulations against the chosen logfile; logfile reopen paths.
  - Preconditions: screen installed setuid root (common for multiuser), attacker can supply a logfile path (e.g., in /tmp) that is a symlink to a privileged file.

Proof of Concept
- Materials
  - PoC script (exploit_poc_script): shell script automating symlink setup and strace capture for vulnerable vs. patched binaries.
  - Commands (build_run_commands) for building test binaries.
- Reproduction steps (vulnerable build / system SUID screen)
  1) Ensure availability of a SUID-root screen (exploit_binaries: /usr/bin/screen 4.05.00) or build 4.5.0.
  2) Execute the PoC:
     - ./exploit_symlink_poc.sh /usr/bin/screen /etc/screen_poc /tmp/screenlog-poc
     - The script links /tmp/screenlog-poc -> /etc/screen_poc and runs: screen -L /tmp/screenlog-poc under strace.
  3) Expected observation (exploit_logs_vulnerable): strace shows openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/screenlog-poc", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) occurring immediately during option parsing. In our sandbox, this returned EACCES due to hardened policies; on typical systems, it risks creating/truncating the target as root.
- Negative control (patched build)
  - Run: ./exploit_symlink_poc.sh ./patched-screen-4.5.1/screen /etc/screen_poc /tmp/screenlog-poc
  - Expected (exploit_logs_patched): no open/openat/creat on the logfile path during option parsing; program exits early if not attached to a terminal, confirming the fix.
- Safety notes
  - Do not point the symlink to truly sensitive files on production systems. Validate in an isolated lab. The PoC uses strace to observe behavior without requiring successful overwrite.

Impact Analysis
- With screen installed setuid root, a local user can cause screen 4.5.0 to create or truncate arbitrary files referenced by a controlled symlink at logfile path, crossing from user to root-controlled file system objects. This can facilitate privilege escalation (e.g., modifying root-owned files), denial of service (truncating logs/configs), or persistence.

Mitigations and Remediation
- Remediation
  - Upgrade to GNU Screen 4.5.1 or later (fixed_target). For distributions, backport the change that removes early fopen in -L handling and defers to secure logfile reopen (diff_summary).
- Immediate mitigations (if upgrade/backport is delayed)
  - Remove setuid bit from /usr/bin/screen or replace with capabilities if feasible (may impact multiuser features).
  - Enforce kernel hardening: fs.protected_symlinks=1 and fs.protected_hardlinks=1; prefer sticky + restricted directories for temporary files.
  - Constrain screen via MAC policy (AppArmor/SELinux) to prevent writes to sensitive paths from the screen domain.
  - Avoid using -L with untrusted paths; restrict logfile to user-owned directories.

Detection and Monitoring
- Indicators of exploitation
  - screen invoked with -L and a logfile path in world-writable locations (e.g., /tmp) followed by immediate open/creat/truncate operations.
- How to detect
  - Use auditd rules (audit_rules_screen) to track executions of /usr/bin/screen with euid=0 and file creation syscalls near invocation.
  - During testing/IR, strace or equivalent syscall tracing can confirm presence/absence of early opens; see exploit_logs_vulnerable and exploit_logs_patched for patterns.

versions
[04:14:59]
Detected versions/variants: vulnerable-screen-4.5.0 (treated as vulnerable), patched-screen-4.5.1 (treated as patched). Rule applied: lowest semantic version is vulnerable; no -vuln suffix present.


diff_summary
[04:36:57]
Major diffs between 4.5.0 and 4.5.1:
- Security fix (CVE-2017-5618) acknowledged in ChangeLog: "logfile permissions problem".
- CLI change: -L split: now -L just enables logging; -Logfile sets path. Help text updated. Parsing implemented in screen.c: parses case 'L' to accept "-Logfile" variant; input validation on PATH_MAX; no early fopen for write used anymore as path check.
- Initialization: real/effective uid/gid captured earlier; logreopen_register called. Added include of limits.h for PATH_MAX on Sun.
- Z0/Z1 width made const and defined in ansi.c; all extern declarations updated.
- Numerous cleanups in layer.c (function prototypes, logic, formatting) and display.c small fixes; one division by zero guard in canvas.c.
- termcap.c removes mutable init of Z0width/Z1width in favor of consts.
- Minor fixes: typo in acls.c (succeeded), bug fixes in socket.c/termcap.c/process.c.
- No diff in logfile.c/h; but security behavior depends on reopen handler lf_secreopen and logreopen_register usage.
Security-relevant change: screen.c CLI parsing removes user-controlled fopen("w") pre-check for -L filename (now -Logfile). Thus avoids creating/truncating arbitrary files with user-supplied name during option parse and defers secure open via secopen in lf_secreopen (used by logfile reopen) which preserves ownership/permissions policies.


vuln_indicators
[04:15:54]
CVE-2017-5618: logfile permissions/logfile reopening security. Patched adds secure reopen via lf_secreopen (secopen) and CLI change: -L only enables logging; -Logfile sets path; earlier version allowed -L file and probed fopen/fwrite pre-drop? Potential unsafe creation with mode 0666 and euid misuse. Other fixes: division by zero (canvas.c), mouse/input handling vars init, const globals for Z widths, syslog msg typo, Solaris include.


vulnerable_targets
[04:16:10]
Vulnerable: vulnerable-screen-4.5.0. Patched: patched-screen-4.5.1. Entry points: ./screen CLI, config files (~/.screenrc), sockets in $SCREENDIR (or /tmp/screens-$USER). Logging options -L (enable), -Logfile file (patched) vs -L file (vulnerable).


vulnerable_code_locations
[04:38:11]
- vulnerable-screen-4.5.0/screen.c: in main(), option parsing switch case 'L' pre-checks logfile path by calling fopen(screenlogfile, "w") before dropping privileges; see around the block starting at "case 'L':" where it assigns screenlogfile = SaveStr(*++av); then validates, then does FILE *w_check = fopen(screenlogfile, "w"); fclose(w_check). This can create/truncate arbitrary paths and follow symlinks when binary is setuid or running with higher privs.
- patched-screen-4.5.1/screen.c: replaces the above with -Logfile handling; no fopen in option parse; relies on later secure open via secopen in lf_secreopen registered with logreopen_register().
- vulnerable-screen-4.5.0/screen.c: real_uid/real_gid/eff_uid/eff_gid are set after the CLI loop; thus the pre-open runs with initial euid (potentially root) if the binary is installed setuid, aggravating impact.
- patched-screen-4.5.1/screen.c: captures real/effective uids/gids earlier and has no pre-open side effect.


build_instructions
[04:18:25]
cd vulnerable-screen-4.5.0 && ./configure && make; cd ../patched-screen-4.5.1 && ./configure && make. Run: ./screen [options]. For logging: vulnerable: ./screen -L /tmp/any; patched: ./screen -Logfile /tmp/any -L. Tests may need term env TERM=xterm and HOME set to writable dir.


attack_surface
[04:34:36]
CLI options: -L (vuln: takes filename and performs fopen("w") as EUID during parsing); -Logfile (patched). Files: ~/.screenrc, custom rc via -c, source directive. Sockets: /tmp/screens-$USER. Logfile reopen path via signals. Windows/PTY. Potential symlink attacks against logfile path.


vulnerable_functions
[04:35:37]
- vulnerable-screen-4.5.0/screen.c: option parsing 'case L' opens user-supplied logfile path with fopen(..., "w") before dropping privileges; creates/truncates files as EUID (potentially root). - vulnerable-screen-4.5.0/window.c: DoStartLog uses secfopen(), but only reached after CLI parse. - patched-screen-4.5.1/screen.c: moves uid/gid capture earlier, replaces -L file with -Logfile, defers file open to DoStartLog and registers lf_secreopen using secopen(). - fileio.c: secopen()/secfopen() perform opens under real uid with checks.


vuln_target
[04:36:44]
vulnerable-screen-4.5.0 (selected as vulnerable by lowest semantic version rule and folder name indicates vulnerable)


fixed_target
[04:36:49]
patched-screen-4.5.1 (selected as non-vulnerable by highest semantic version rule)


attack_surfaces
[04:37:03]
- CLI argument parsing in screen.c (options: -L/-Logfile, -S session name, -p window, -c rc file, -T term). Potential for path traversals, symlink/race in logfile path, overly long names, environment variable parsing.
- Log file management (logfile.c with logreopen_register via lf_secreopen using secopen; stolen_logfile detection and reopen). Race conditions/symlink attacks on log files (CWE-59, CWE-367) in vulnerable version.
- File/dir creation for $SCREENDIR (socket dir) in screen.c: mkdir with 0700, handling of umask, UserContext; permission checks.
- Socket handling in socket.c (creation under SockDir, name parsing, NAME_MAX enforcement). Potential local privilege misuse.
- Setuid/multiuser code paths (MULTIUSER, suid root requirement) affect privilege boundary.
- Environment: $HOME, $SCREENDIR, $STY, $TERM, $NETHACKOPTIONS. TTY path validation via CheckTtyname.
- Terminal capability parsing and input decoding (termcap.c/ansi.c) but less likely for RCE; more for memory safety.
- Race in canvas.c fixed (division by zero) not a security exploit.
- Process handling in process.c (commands like log/relog, window creation, input parsing commands).


build_run_commands
[04:37:14]
Build:
- cd vulnerable-screen-4.5.0 && ./configure && make -j$(nproc)
- cd patched-screen-4.5.1 && ./configure && make -j$(nproc)
Run basic:
- ./vulnerable-screen-4.5.0/screen -L -Logfile /tmp/screenlog-test (patched uses -L to enable and -Logfile to set name; vulnerable only -L <file>)
- ./vulnerable-screen-4.5.0/screen -L /tmp/screenlog-test
- ./patched-screen-4.5.1/screen -L -Logfile /tmp/screenlog-test
Exercise logging reopen:
- In another shell, move or replace the log file to test stolen_logfile reopen behavior. For vulnerable, test symlink to target file: ln -sf /etc/passwd /tmp/screenlog-test; check if pre-fopen("w") truncates; patched avoids this pre-fopen.
Env notes:
- No external services required. TERM must be set. For multiuser paths, avoid suid in sandbox.


entry_points
[04:37:20]
Primary entry point: screen.c:main(int ac, char **av).
Reachable via CLI:
- Start session: ./screen [options]
- Enable logging (vuln): ./vulnerable-screen-4.5.0/screen -L /path
- Enable logging (patched): ./patched-screen-4.5.1/screen -L -Logfile /path
- Other options to exercise file I/O: -c /path/to/rc, -S name, -T term
Runtime command interface via stdin/tty (process.c handles ':' commands).


cwe_hypotheses
[04:37:32]
- CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access in a Directory Traversal): Vulnerable version pre-creates/truncates logfile path during option parse with fopen(path, "w") allowing symlink/hardlink attacks to arbitrary files (CVE-2017-5618 class). Patched replaces this with -Logfile parsing and relies on secure reopen via secopen.
- CWE-367 (TOCTOU Race Condition): logfile stolen detection and reopen; vulnerable pre-write test opens file early with uncoordinated checks.
- CWE-22 (Path Traversal): User controls logfile path; length checks exist; no traversal normalization; but impact is via symlink/permission.
- CWE-362 (Race Condition): Potential races around SockDir creation/mkdir and file operations under $SCREENDIR; however code uses 0700 and UserContext; not primary.
Obvious PoC trigger:
- On 4.5.0: create symlink at target log path pointing to sensitive file; run "./screen -L /path/symlink"; due to pre-check fopen("w"), it may truncate or create file with user perms. Compare behavior to 4.5.1 which should not pre-open here.

exploit_logs_vulnerable
[04:54:41]
Strace (vulnerable binary): openat(AT_FDCWD, "/tmp/screenlog-poc", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied). This occurs immediately during option parsing before tty setup, demonstrating premature file open following symlink. Our /usr/bin/screen (4.5.0, setuid root) also exhibits this behavior. No creation of /etc/screen_poc due to hardened /tmp permissions in this container.


exploit_logs_patched
[04:54:44]
Strace (patched 4.5.1 build): no open/openat/creat on provided logfile path observed during option parsing with '-L -Logfile /tmp/screenlog-poc'. Program exits early with 'Must be connected to a terminal' without touching the logfile, confirming the fix.


exploit_binaries
[04:57:04]
