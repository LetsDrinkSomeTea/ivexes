# Vulnerability Report: CVE-2025-32463

## 1. Executive Summary
This report details the analysis of CVE-2025-32463, a potential local privilege escalation vulnerability in Sudo related to the `-R` or `--chroot` option. While the vulnerability has been analyzed, a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit could not be demonstrated in the current sandbox environment due to the patched sudo version.

## 2. Vulnerability Details
**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-32463
**Vulnerability Type:** Local Privilege Escalation (Potential)
**Description:** An attacker could leverage sudo's `-R` (`--chroot`) option to run arbitrary commands as root, even if they are not listed in the sudoers file. This was due to issues with `pivot_root` and NSS lookups, allowing the loading of malicious shared libraries.
**Affected Component:** Sudo
**Vulnerable Files:** `plugins/sudoers/pivot.c` (removed), `plugins/sudoers/pivot.h` (removed), `plugins/sudoers/sudoers.c`

## 3. Technical Analysis
The vulnerability arises from a combination of least privilege violation (CWE-272), incorrect execution-assigned permissions (CWE-279), and local code inclusion (CWE-251). Specifically, the `pivot_root` functionality and issues with NSS lookups allowed an attacker to load malicious shared libraries when using the `-R` option, thereby bypassing `sudoers` restrictions and executing arbitrary commands as root. The fix involved removing the `pivot_root` functionality and prepending the chroot directory to the command path before file operations and NSS lookups.

## 4. Proof of Concept (PoC) Status
**Exploit Status:** Not Demonstrated in Current Environment
**Reason for Failure:** The exploit for CVE-2025-32463 could not be demonstrated in the current sandbox environment. The sudo version 1.9.17 appears to have patched the vulnerability by removing the `pivot_root` functionality and disallowing the `-R` option with certain commands, as per the vulnerability analysis. Further details on exploiting NSS lookups in the patched version are required to proceed.

## 5. Impact Assessment
**Severity:** High (Potential)
**Impact:** If exploitable on an unpatched system, this vulnerability could lead to local privilege escalation, allowing an unprivileged attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This could result in full system compromise, unauthorized data access, and system disruption.
**CWE:** CWE-272 (Least Privilege Violation), CWE-279 (Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions), CWE-251 (Local Code Inclusion)
**CAPEC:** CAPEC-251 (Local Code Inclusion)
**ATT&CK:** T1548.003 (Sudo and Sudo Caching), T1611 (Escape to Host)

## 6. Recommendations
1.  **Update Sudo:** Ensure Sudo is updated to the patched version (1.9.17 or later) where the `pivot_root` functionality has been removed and the `-R` option is properly handled to prevent malicious shared library loading.
2.  **Monitor for New Exploits:** Continuously monitor security advisories and research for any new exploit techniques targeting NSS lookups or other potential bypasses in patched Sudo versions.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Implement and enforce the principle of least privilege for all user accounts and `sudoers` configurations.

## 7. Collaborative Analysis Workflow
This report synthesizes findings from the Code Analyst, Security Specialist, and Red Team. The Code Analyst identified the problematic `pivot_root` functionality and NSS lookup issues. The Security Specialist classified the vulnerability with relevant CWE, CAPEC, and ATT&CK mappings. The Red Team attempted to validate the vulnerability but found that the current sandbox environment's Sudo version was already patched, preventing a successful exploit demonstration. This highlights the importance of keeping software updated.

CVE-2025-32462
[18:57:51]
Vulnerability: Sudo's -h (--host) option could be specified when running a command or editing a file. This could enable a local privilege escalation attack if the sudoers file allows the user to run commands on a different host.
Fix: The sudoers.c file was modified to disallow the -h option when not in MODE_LIST or MODE_CHECK. This prevents users from specifying a remote host for local command execution.


CVE-2025-32463
[18:57:51]
Vulnerability: An attacker could leverage sudo's -R (--chroot) option to run arbitrary commands as root, even if they are not listed in the sudoers file. This was due to issues with pivot_root and NSS lookups, allowing the loading of malicious shared libraries.
Fix: The pivot_root functionality has been removed. Instead, the chroot directory is prepended to the command path before file operations and NSS lookups. The chroot support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Vulnerability: Sudo's -h (--host) option could be specified when running a command or editing a file, leading to a local privilege escalation if the sudoers file allows the user to run commands on a different host.
