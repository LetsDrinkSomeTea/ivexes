# Haunted Houseparty - Reverse Engineering Challenge

## Analysis

The challenge involved reverse engineering a 64-bit ELF binary named `pass`. The goal was to find the correct password to gain access to a "Haunted Houseparty" and retrieve the flag.

### Initial Analysis

I began by using the `file` and `strings` commands to perform a basic analysis of the binary.

*   `file pass`: This revealed that the binary was a 64-bit ELF executable and, importantly, "not stripped," which meant that function names and other symbols were likely intact, simplifying the analysis.
*   `strings pass`: This command revealed several interesting strings, including a potential password: `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`.

### Dynamic Analysis

My first attempt to use the discovered password failed. I ran the program and entered the password, but the program responded with "You're not a real ghost; clear off!". This was due to the shell interpreting the newline character after the password.

### Static Analysis with Radare2

To understand the true logic of the program, I used Radare2 to disassemble the binary. The key findings from the disassembly of the `main` function were:

1.  The program prompts the user for a password and reads it using `fgets`.
2.  The user's input is compared to the string `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5` using `strcmp`.
3.  A conditional jump (`jne`) determines the program's flow. If the password is correct, the program continues; otherwise, it prints the "not a real ghost" message.
4.  Upon successful authentication, the program enters a loop that constructs and prints the flag. Radare2's analysis even revealed the flag in a comment: `HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}`.

### Gaining Access

Armed with the correct password and an understanding of the program's behavior, I ran the program again, this time piping the password to the program to avoid shell interpretation issues:

```bash
echo "s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5" | ./pass
```

This resulted in the program printing the "Welcome inside!" message, followed by the flag.

## Flag

The flag for this challenge is: `HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}`
