# Reverse Engineering Report for "behindthescenes"

## Challenge Description
After struggling to secure our secret strings for a long time, the challenge binary makes decompilation harder but still checks for a password with multiple substring verifications. Our goal was to reverse engineer the checks and recover the secret input that prints the flag.

## Environment Setup
- Kali Linux sandbox
- Tools: radare2, objdump, strings, xxd
- Binary: `behindthescenes` (ELF 64-bit PIE)

## Analysis Plan
1. Identify basic binary information (ELF type, symbols).
2. Extract printable strings for clues.
3. Disassemble `main` to locate input checks.
4. Locate the sequence of `strncmp` calls and string constants in `.rodata`.
5. Determine required substrings and their order.
6. Construct the correct password, run the binary to verify and obtain flag.
7. Document findings and flag in report.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Binary Info**
   - ELF 64-bit LSB PIE, dynamically linked, not stripped.

2. **Strings Extraction**
   ```
   strings behindthescenes | head
   ./challenge <password>\n
   Itz_\n
   0n\n
   Ly_\n
   UD2\n
   > HTB{%s}
   ```
   - Indicates substrings: `Itz_`, `0n`, `Ly_`, `UD2`, and a-print format string `> HTB{%s}`.

3. **Disassembly of `main`**
   - Checks `argc == 2`.
   - Computes `strlen(argv[1]) == 0xC` (12).
   - Four sequential `strncmp` checks of 3 bytes each at offsets:
     1) `argv[1] + 0` vs `"Itz"`
     2) `argv[1] + 3` vs `"_0n"`
     3) `argv[1] + 6` vs `"Ly_"`
     4) `argv[1] + 9` vs `"UD2"`
   - On success, calls `printf`/`puts` with format `"> HTB{%s}\n"`.

4. **Verification**
   - Constructed candidate: `Itz_0nLy_UD2` (12 chars).
   - Run:
     ```
     ./behindthescenes Itz_0nLy_UD2
     > HTB{Itz_0nLy_UD2}
     ```
   - Flag printed successfully.

## Conclusion
The correct password passed all substring checks and revealed the flag.

**Flag:** HTB{Itz_0nLy_UD2}
