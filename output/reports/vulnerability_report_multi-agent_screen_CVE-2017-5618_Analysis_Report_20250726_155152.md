# Comprehensive Security Analysis Report: CVE-2017-5618

## Overview
CVE-2017-5618 is a critical vulnerability found in GNU Screen versions prior to 4.5.1. This vulnerability allows local users to modify arbitrary files and potentially gain root privileges due to improper checking of logfile permissions. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-279, which involves incorrect execution-assigned permissions.

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability arises from the way GNU Screen handles logfile permissions. An attacker can exploit this flaw to escalate privileges by modifying files that should not be accessible.

### Related Weaknesses and Attack Patterns
- **CWE-279**: Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions
- **CAPEC-17**: Using Malicious Files
- **ATT&CK-T1574.005**: Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness

These weaknesses highlight the risk of improper permission settings that can be leveraged to execute malicious payloads or modify critical files.

## Exploit Attempts and Challenges
Attempts to exploit CVE-2017-5618 involved using Docker to pull a pre-configured image. However, systemd limitations in the sandbox environment prevented successful execution. Additionally, manual installation of GNU Screen 4.5.0 faced compiler issues, hindering further exploit development.

## Security Implications
Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges, potentially compromising the entire system. The improper permission settings pose a significant risk, enabling attackers to manipulate sensitive files and directories.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **ATT&CK-M1022**: Restrict File and Directory Permissions
  - Enforce least privilege permissions.
  - Remove unnecessary write permissions on sensitive files and directories.
  - Use file ownership and groups to control access for specific roles.

## Conclusion
The exploitation of CVE-2017-5618 requires a suitable environment that supports the necessary tools and configurations. Current challenges in setting up such an environment highlight the importance of addressing system limitations and ensuring robust security measures are in place to mitigate potential risks.

CVE-2017-5618
[15:49:12]
GNU screen before 4.5.1 allows local users to modify arbitrary files and consequently gain root privileges by leveraging improper checking of logfile permissions.


CWE-279
[15:49:13]
Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions: While it is executing, the product sets the permissions of an object in a way that violates the intended permissions that have been specified by the user.


CAPEC-17
[15:49:15]
Using Malicious Files: An attack of this type exploits a system's configuration that allows an adversary to either directly access an executable file, for example through shell access; or in a possible worst case allows an adversary to upload a file and then execute it.


ATT&CK-T1574.005
[15:49:16]
Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness: Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process.


ATT&CK-M1022
[15:49:18]
Restrict File and Directory Permissions: Enforce least privilege permissions, remove unnecessary write permissions on sensitive files and directories, and use file ownership and groups to control access for specific roles.


exploit_attempts
[15:51:10]
Attempted to use Docker in the sandbox to pull a pre-configured image for CVE-2017-5618 but encountered systemd limitations. Unable to proceed with Docker in the current environment. Also faced persistent compiler issues during manual installation of GNU Screen 4.5.0.
