# Reverse Engineering Report: behindthescenes

## Challenge Description

The challenge involves reverse engineering a binary named `behindthescenes` to retrieve a flag. The program prompts for a password and outputs a flag if the correct password is provided.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Initial Analysis**: The binary is a 64-bit ELF executable, dynamically linked, and not stripped.

2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Running the program prompts for a password.

3. **Static Analysis**:
   - Used `strings` to identify potential strings in the binary.
   - Disassembled the binary using `objdump` to analyze the `main` function.
   - Identified `strncmp` operations comparing segments of the input password against specific values.
   - Extracted strings from the `.rodata` section, revealing segments used in password validation.

4. **Password Construction**:
   - The password is constructed from segments found in the `.rodata` section: `Itz`, `_0n`, `Ly_`, `UD2`.
   - The complete password is `Itz_0nLy_UD2`.

5. **Flag Retrieval**:
   - Running the program with the password `Itz_0nLy_UD2` reveals the flag: `HTB{Itz_0nLy_UD2}`.

## Conclusion

The flag for the challenge is `HTB{Itz_0nLy_UD2}`. The challenge involved understanding the password validation logic through static analysis and constructing the correct password from identified segments.
