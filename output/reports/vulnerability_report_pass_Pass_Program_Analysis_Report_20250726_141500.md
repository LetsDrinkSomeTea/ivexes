# Pass Program Analysis Report

## Challenge Description
The challenge involved reverse engineering a program named "pass" to obtain a flag. The prompt stated: "All the coolest ghosts in town are going to a Haunted Houseparty - can you prove you deserve to get in?"

## Tools Used
* `file`: To identify the file type.
* `strings`: To extract printable strings from the binary.
* `ltrace`: To trace library calls made by the program.
* `radare2`: A powerful reverse engineering framework for detailed analysis of the binary.

## Analysis Steps

1.  **Initial Reconnaissance:**
    *   Used `file pass` to determine the binary type: `ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, not stripped`. This indicated a standard Linux executable.
    *   Executed `./pass` to observe its behavior. It prompted for a password: "Welcome to the SPOOKIEST party of the year. Before we let you in, you'll need to give us the password: ".

2.  **Dynamic Analysis with `ltrace`:**
    *   Ran `ltrace ./pass` to observe library calls. The output showed calls to `fgets` (likely for reading input) and `strcmp` (likely for comparing the input with a stored password). This confirmed the program's basic authentication mechanism.

3.  **Static Analysis with `strings`:**
    *   Used `strings pass | head` to quickly look for any obvious strings. The output included `fgets`, `puts`, `strcmp`, and notably, `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`. This string immediately stood out as a potential password.

4.  **Detailed Static Analysis with `radare2`:**
    *   Opened the binary in `radare2` (`r2 -A pass`).
    *   Listed functions using `afl`. The `main` function was of interest.
    *   Disassembled the `main` function using `pdf @ main`.
    *   Within the `main` function's disassembly, the `strcmp` call was clearly visible. One of its arguments was the string `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`, confirming it as the hardcoded password.

## Solution

Based on the analysis, the program compares the user's input with the string "s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5".

1.  Exited `radare2`.
2.  Executed `./pass`.
3.  Entered `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5` as the password.

## Flag
The program outputted "Welcome inside!" followed by the flag:
`HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}`

## Conclusion
The challenge was a straightforward reverse engineering task. The password was directly present as an un-obfuscated string within the binary, making it easily discoverable using basic static analysis tools like `strings` and `radare2`. The flag itself, `un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5`, humorously confirms this.
