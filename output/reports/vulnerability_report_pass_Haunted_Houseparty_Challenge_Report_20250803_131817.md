# HackTheBox Challenge: Haunted Houseparty

## Analysis

- The binary `pass` is a 64-bit ELF executable.
- Running `strings` on the binary revealed a cleartext password: `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`.
- Running the binary prompts for a password to enter the party.
- Inputting the discovered password interactively grants access and reveals the flag.

## Flag

```
HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}
```

## Conclusion

The challenge was straightforward as the password was stored in plaintext within the binary. The key step was to input the password interactively after running the program to receive the flag.
