# Path to the Haunted Houseparty: Reverse Engineering `pass`

## Challenge Description
All the coolest ghosts in town are going to a Haunted Houseparty—can you prove you deserve to get in?

## Objectives
1. Identify the intended password hidden inside the binary.
2. Supply the password to the program and capture the flag output.

## Environment Setup
- **Platform**: Kali Linux sandbox
- **Binary**: `pass` (ELF 64-bit PIE executable)

## High-Level Plan
1. Inspect the file type and binary metadata.
2. Extract embedded strings looking for passwords or clues.
3. Disassemble the main function to confirm the authentication logic.
4. Supply the discovered password to the program to retrieve the flag.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. File Identification
```bash
file pass
# -> ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked
```

### 2. Strings Extraction
```bash
strings pass | grep -i "s3cr3t"
# -> s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5
```
This clearly looks like a candidate authentication string.

### 3. Quick Manual Run
```bash
$ echo "s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5" | ./pass
Welcome inside!
HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}
```
The output confirms that the embedded string is indeed the correct password and that the flag is printed on successful authentication.

### 4. Disassembly of `main`
A partial disassembly confirms the program flow:
```asm
1189 <main>:
  1194: puts("Welcome to the SPOOKIEST party...");
  11e5: puts("Before we let you in, you'll need to give us the password:");
  ...
  # read input with fgets and compare with hardcoded string
  ...
  if (strcmp(input, hardcoded_password) == 0)
    puts("Welcome inside!");
    printf("%s", flag);
  else
    puts("You're not a real ghost; clear off!");
```
No obfuscation—just an unprotected static string.

## Conclusion
We successfully extracted the password and obtained the flag.

**Flag:** HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}
