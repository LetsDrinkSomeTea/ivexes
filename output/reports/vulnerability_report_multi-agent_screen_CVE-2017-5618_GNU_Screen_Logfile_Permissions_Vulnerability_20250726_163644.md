# Security Analysis Report: CVE-2017-5618 in GNU Screen 4.5.0

## 1. Overview
CVE-2017-5618 is a security vulnerability in GNU Screen version 4.5.0 related to insecure logfile permissions. The issue arises from improper creation and management of log files that are created with overly permissive access rights, potentially allowing local attackers to read or manipulate sensitive log data. This vulnerability was addressed and fixed in GNU Screen version 4.5.1.

The affected version in our sandbox environment is confirmed as GNU Screen 4.5.0, which supports the `-L <filename>` command line option for logfile specification. The patched version 4.5.1 modifies this to `-Logfile <filename>` with enhanced security checks.

---

## 2. Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### 2.1 Logfile Permissions Issue
The core of CVE-2017-5618 lies in the insecure creation of logfile files with permissive file modes (0666) without adequate validation or enforcement of stricter permissions. This allows any local user to potentially read or modify log files created by GNU Screen.

### 2.2 Code Changes and Fixes
- In the vulnerable 4.5.0 version, the logfile is created using `fopen` with minimal validation.
- The patched 4.5.1 version introduces improved command line parsing for the `-Logfile` option, including checks against filename length and validity.
- The logfile is opened securely in the function `lf_secreopen()` using `secopen()` with flags `O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND` and mode `0666`. Although mode 0666 is permissive, `secopen()` likely applies additional security measures such as privilege dropping or umask enforcement.
- The patch adds validation to prevent logfile names starting with `-` and checks for write access before opening.
- Key code locations involved are the `main()` function's command line parsing for the logfile option and the `lf_secreopen()` function for secure logfile opening.

### 2.3 Patch Summary
The patch diff between versions 4.5.0 and 4.5.1 includes:
- Fixes for logfile permissions vulnerability.
- Improved logfile option parsing.
- Addition of real user and group ID initialization.
- Various minor bug fixes unrelated to this vulnerability.

## 3. Attack Patterns and Exploitation Scenarios

### 3.1 CWE and CAPEC Classifications
- CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions
- CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
- CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File

- CAPEC-17: Using Malicious Files
- CAPEC-445: Malicious Logic Insertion via Configuration Management Manipulation
- CAPEC-678: System Build Data Maliciously Altered

### 3.2 MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
- T1574.005: Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness
- T1222: File and Directory Permissions Modification
- T1070.002: Clear Linux or Mac System Logs
- T1562.003: Impair Command History Logging
- T1546.004: Unix Shell Configuration Modification

### 3.3 Exploitation Scenarios
- A local attacker can read sensitive information such as passwords or tokens from log files due to overly permissive file permissions.
- Attackers may modify or replace log files to hide malicious activity or inject malicious payloads.
- Potential privilege escalation or persistence by altering files used by privileged processes.

---

## 4. Proof-of-Concept Exploit and Validation

### 4.1 PoC Description
A bash script was developed to demonstrate the vulnerability:
- It creates an attacker-controlled directory with world-writable permissions.
- Runs the vulnerable GNU Screen 4.5.0 with the `-L` option pointing to a logfile in this directory.
- After execution, it shows that the logfile is created with permissive read permissions.
- The attacker can read the logfile content but cannot write to it, confirming information disclosure risk.

### 4.2 Validation Results
- The logfile permissions were confirmed to be insecurely set, allowing unauthorized read access.
- Attempts to write to the logfile as an unprivileged user failed, indicating partial permission control.
- This confirms the vulnerability allows information disclosure but not direct file tampering or overwriting.

---

## 5. Impact Assessment

- **Confidentiality:** High risk due to potential exposure of sensitive information in log files.
- **Integrity:** Moderate risk if attackers manipulate log files to hide activities.
- **Availability:** Low risk; the vulnerability does not directly affect service availability.
- **Overall:** The vulnerability poses a significant local privilege and information disclosure risk.

---

## 6. Recommendations and Mitigations

- Upgrade GNU Screen to version 4.5.1 or later where the vulnerability is fixed.
- Enforce strict file permissions (e.g., 0600) on log files created by applications.
- Avoid logging sensitive information such as passwords or tokens.
- Validate and sanitize logfile paths and names to prevent symlink or directory traversal attacks.
- Employ secure file open functions that respect umask and privilege boundaries.

---

## 7. Team Collaboration and Analysis Workflow

- **Security Specialist:** Classified the vulnerability with CWE, CAPEC, and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks and outlined exploitation scenarios.
- **Code Analyst:** Performed detailed code review of `screen.c` logfile handling and patch diff analysis.
- **Red Team Operator:** Developed and executed a proof-of-concept exploit validating the vulnerability.
- **Report Journalist (this report):** Synthesized all findings into a comprehensive, accessible report.

This collaborative approach ensured a thorough understanding and validation of CVE-2017-5618.

analysis_screen_c_logfile_handling_CVE-2017-5618
[16:31:25]
The patched screen.c file handles logfile creation and command line parsing for the '-Logfile' option with improved security:

- The '-Logfile <filename>' option requires a valid filename argument and checks length against PATH_MAX.
- The logfile filename is stored in 'screenlogfile' and freed before reassignment.
- The logfile is opened in lf_secreopen() using secopen() with flags O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND and mode 0666.
- The mode 0666 is permissive, but secopen likely applies additional security checks or privilege dropping.
- The patch fixed CVE-2017-5618 by adding checks for logfile name validity and access before opening.
- Potential vulnerabilities include world-writable logfile creation and symlink attacks if umask or secopen do not enforce strict permissions.
- Attackers with local access could exploit improper logfile handling for information disclosure or privilege escalation.

Key code locations:
- main() function command line parsing around case 'L' for '-Logfile'
- lf_secreopen() function for secure logfile opening

This analysis highlights the importance of validating logfile paths and enforcing strict permissions on logfile creation to mitigate CVE-2017-5618.


vulnerable_version_4.5.0_info
[16:33:11]
The sandbox environment has GNU Screen version 4.5.0 installed as confirmed by ChangeLog and README metadata.

Version 4.5.0 supports the command line option '-L <filename>' to specify the logfile name.
The logfile name must not start with '-' and is checked for write access using fopen before use.

This differs from the patched version 4.5.1 which uses '-Logfile <filename>' and improved secure open handling.

This confirms the environment is running the vulnerable 4.5.0 version with older, less secure logfile handling.
