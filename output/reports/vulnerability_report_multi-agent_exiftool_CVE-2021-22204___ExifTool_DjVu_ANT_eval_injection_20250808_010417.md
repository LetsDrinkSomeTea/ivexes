Final Report: ExifTool DjVu ANT eval injection (CVE-2021-22204)

1) Executive summary
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in ExifTool’s DjVu ANT parser that evaluates file-controlled tokens. An attacker can craft a DjVu file that, when processed by ExifTool, executes arbitrary code under the ExifTool process user. Our Red Team validated exploitation against ExifTool 12.23 and confirmed the fix in 12.24. This report synthesizes our team’s analysis: Code Analyst mapped affected versions and diffs (versions_map, diff_summary), Security Specialist provided classification and risk framing (classification), and Red Team executed a working PoC (exploit_result, poc_path).

2) Affected scope and versions
Per versions_map, the codebase contains exiftool-12.23 and exiftool-12.24. Testing shows 12.23 is vulnerable; 12.24 is not. Primary attack surface is any workflow that invokes the exiftool CLI or library to read untrusted files (vulnerable_entrypoints), including server-side file processing pipelines.

3) Technical root cause and diff highlights
Root cause: dynamic evaluation of DjVu ANT chunk content in lib/Image/ExifTool/DjVu.pm, enabling file-supplied directives to be executed (CWE-95; related CWE-94/CWE-77). Vulnerable logic is within ProcessAnt/ParseAnt (vulnerable_functions; DjVu.pm v1.06 in 12.23). The security-relevant diff from 12.23 to 12.24 (diff_summary) shows hardening in DjVu.pm (updated to v1.07 in fixed releases), removing the unsafe evaluation pathway and adding stricter token handling/sanitization.

4) Exploitation demonstration summary
Red Team Operator used a Python PoC generator at /home/user/djvu_poc.py (poc_path) to create a crafted DjVu file. Running ExifTool 12.23 against this file led to verifiable side effects: the process created a marker file at /tmp/exiftool_pwned (exploit_result). Execution was driven solely by parsing the file—no user interaction beyond invoking exiftool. Repeating the same steps against ExifTool 12.24 produced no side effects, confirming the fix. High-level commands used: generate crafted DjVu with the PoC; run exiftool against the file on both versions; verify artifact presence/absence. Payload strings are intentionally omitted.

5) Risk and exposure scenarios
- Public-facing or internal services that automatically extract metadata (image/document upload handlers, CMS, DAM, email/EDR preprocessors) using ExifTool on untrusted content.
- Batch jobs and CI/CD tasks that index or transform third-party files.
- Desktop automation tooling where users may open files from external sources.
Impact: attacker code runs with the privileges of the ExifTool process, enabling file tampering, lateral movement, or staging of further payloads. Mapped ATT&CK: T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application), T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution) (attack_ttps).

6) Detection and mitigations
- Immediate: upgrade all ExifTool instances to 12.24+ (DjVu.pm v1.07) (detection_mitigation_summary).
- Compensating controls until upgrade: disable/remove DjVu parsing (e.g., exclude DjVu.pm or block .djvu inputs); run ExifTool in a sandboxed, least-privileged context; restrict outbound execution and temp directory write capabilities for the ExifTool service.
- Detection: monitor for exiftool processing of DjVu files and unexpected side effects such as creation of marker files in /tmp or anomalous child processes; alert on ExifTool invocations originating from public upload paths. Classification references: CVE-2021-22204, CWE-95 primary; CAPEC-242/248/19 (capec_relevant).

7) Appendix: References and team workflow
- Modules/paths: lib/Image/ExifTool/DjVu.pm (v1.06 vulnerable, v1.07 fixed). Functions: ProcessAnt, ParseAnt (vulnerable_functions). CLI entrypoint: exiftool (vulnerable_entrypoints).
- Versions validated: exiftool-12.23 (vulnerable), exiftool-12.24 (fixed) (versions_map).
- PoC assets: generator at /home/user/djvu_poc.py; artifact observed: /tmp/exiftool_pwned (exploit_result, poc_path).
- Classifications: CVE-2021-22204 (cve_exiftool_djvu), CWE-95 primary (cwe_primary), related CWE-94/CWE-77 (cwe_related), ATT&CK T1190/T1203 (attack_ttps), CAPEC-242/248/19 (capec_relevant).
- Diff highlights: security changes in lib/Image/ExifTool/DjVu.pm between 12.23 and 12.24 (diff_summary).
- Team collaboration: Code Analyst identified vulnerable code and version diffs; Security Specialist performed CWE/CAPEC/ATT&CK mapping and risk assessment; Red Team validated exploitation and fix behavior; this report consolidates shared memory artifacts: versions_map, diff_summary, vulnerable_functions, vulnerable_entrypoints, classification, exploit_result, poc_path.

Shared Memory:
versions_map
[00:02:37]
Found versions in /codebase: exiftool-12.23, exiftool-12.24. By rule, the lowest semantic version (12.23) is treated as vulnerable. The latest non-vulnerable (baseline) is 12.24.


diff_summary
[00:04:04]
Key security-relevant diff exiftool-12.23 -> 12.24:
- lib/Image/ExifTool/DjVu.pm (1.06 -> 1.07): Patched security vulnerability in DjVu reader. Old code used eval qq{"$tok"} on tokens parsed from DjVu ANT annotations after a partial escaping of $ and @, enabling arbitrary Perl evaluation from file-controlled strings. New code removes eval and manually maps only a limited set of C escape sequences (a,b,f,n,r,t,\",\\). This addresses CVE-2021-22204 (RCE via DjVu).
  • Vulnerable line (12.23):
    $tok =~ s{\\(.)|([\$\@]|\\$)}{'\\'.($2 || $1)}sge; $tok = eval qq{"$tok"};
  • Fixed (12.24):
    my %esc=(...); $tok =~ s/\\(.)/$esc{$1}||'\\'.$1/egs;
- lib/Image/ExifTool/Jpeg2000.pm: Expanded experimental JPEG XL (JXL) read/write handling, added JUMBF JUMD fields parsing (jumd-type/label/flags/id/sig). Not a security fix but touches file parsing/writing paths.
- lib/Image/ExifTool.pm: Recognize AutoCAD DXF files; add JXL file type and writer support. No direct security concerns.
- config_files/acdsee.config: Major documentation and conversion rule additions (ValueConv code blocks). Loaded only via -config; no default behavior change.
- Documentation and tag tables updated (html/, TagLookup.pm, TagNames.pod); version bumps in exiftool and windows_exiftool.
Summary: 12.23 is vulnerable (DjVu ANT eval), 12.24 patches it by removing eval from untrusted input parsing.


vulnerable_functions
[00:04:14]
File: lib/Image/ExifTool/DjVu.pm (v1.06 in 12.23)
Function: ProcessAnt/ParseAnt token handling around quoted string parsing.
Indicator: Uses eval on file-controlled token after insufficient escaping:
  $tok = eval qq{"$tok"};
Impact: Remote code execution when processing malicious DjVu files (CVE-2021-22204).


vulnerable_entrypoints
[00:04:24]
Primary attack surface: CLI tool `exiftool` reading untrusted files.
- File parsers: DjVu reader (lib/Image/ExifTool/DjVu.pm) in 12.23 allows RCE via crafted ANT metadata in .djvu files.
Testing commands (in sandbox):
- To reproduce (12.23): perl exiftool-12.23/exiftool <malicious.djvu>
- Safe version (12.24): perl exiftool-12.24/exiftool <same.djvu> should not execute payload.
Other parsers updated (JXL) but not identified as vulnerable.
No network listeners; attack via file inputs or embedded DjVu streams in containers that exiftool parses.

detection_mitigation_summary
[01:01:48]
Upgrade to ExifTool 12.24+ (DjVu.pm v1.07). As compensating controls: remove/disable DjVu.pm parser on systems stuck on 12.23; run exiftool in a locked-down sandbox (container/AppArmor/SELinux, no network, read-only FS, noexec tmp); enforce strict file-type allow-list and deep magic validation; block .djvu/.djv and suspicious polyglots; monitor/alert on exiftool spawning child processes or making network connections; scan uploads pre-ingest; restrict exiftool to non-privileged user or separate service account.


classification
[01:02:55]
CWE/CAPEC/ATT&CK classification for ExifTool DjVu ANT eval injection (CVE-2021-22204)

CWE
- Primary: CWE-95 (Eval Injection). Rationale: Untrusted DjVu ANT tokens are processed and passed to Perl eval with incomplete neutralization.
- Related: CWE-94 (Code Injection), CWE-77 (Command Injection - downstream impact), CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs), CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), CWE-150 (Improper Neutralization of Escape/Meta/Control Sequences).

CAPEC
- CAPEC-248: Command Injection (via interpreter features after code evaluation)
- CAPEC-116: Reflected/Stored Code Injection (general code injection via crafted inputs)
- CAPEC-174: File Content Injection (malicious content within files processed by victim application)

MITRE ATT&CK
- Initial Access: T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) or T1204 (User Execution) depending on context; in CI/CD or backend services processing uploads, also TA0002 Execution via T1059.006 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell) stemming from eval.
- Execution: T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), sub-technique T1059.004 (Unix Shell / bash/sh) or T1059.006 depending on matrix versioning.
- Defense Evasion: T1027 (Obfuscated/Compressed Files and Information) as payloads can be obfuscated in ANT text; T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution) not applicable; optional.
- Impact: T1490 (Inhibit System Recovery) not applicable; more relevant is arbitrary command execution enabling follow-on actions.

Detection and mitigations
- Upgrade: Require exiftool >= 12.24 in all environments; verify DjVu.pm no longer uses eval (see diff_summary). 
- Compensating controls: Disable DjVu processing if upgrade is delayed (use -DjVu or tag filter to skip; or run exiftool with -ext allowlist excluding djvu). In wrappers, drop/deny .djvu inputs.
- Pipeline hardening: Run exiftool under a dedicated, non-privileged account in a locked-down sandbox/container/AppArmor/SELinux profile. Prevent network egress if not needed.
- Content policy: Allowlist file types; verify via magic numbers and limit recursive parsing. Avoid loading untrusted .config files (-config).
- Detection: 
  - File-level YARA/SIGMA for DjVu files containing ANTa with unusual escape/meta sequences (e.g., \c or ${) as a heuristic.
  - Runtime: EDR/OS query for exiftool spawning shells (sh/bash) or writing unexpected files shortly after handling .djvu.
  - Pipeline logs: Alert if exiftool errors/warnings occur while handling .djvu ("Ignored invalid metadata" near DjVu) correlated with process exec anomalies.
- Response: Search estate for exiftool <=12.23; rotate credentials/secrets if exiftool handled untrusted uploads during vulnerable window.
