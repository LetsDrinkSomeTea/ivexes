# Behind The Scenes - HackTheBox Challenge Analysis

## Challenge Overview
The challenge presents a binary that claims to make decompilation harder by using anti-debugging techniques. The goal is to reverse engineer the program and find the hidden flag.

## Technical Analysis

### Binary Information
- **File Type**: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64
- **Architecture**: x86-64
- **Linking**: Dynamically linked
- **Symbols**: Not stripped

### Anti-Debugging Technique
The program uses an interesting anti-debugging technique involving illegal instructions:

1. **Signal Handler Setup**: The program registers a SIGILL (illegal instruction) signal handler using `sigaction()`
2. **UD2 Instructions**: Throughout the code, `ud2` (undefined instruction) opcodes are placed after each check
3. **Signal Handler Logic**: When a `ud2` instruction is hit, it triggers SIGILL. The signal handler (`segill_sigaction`) adds 2 to the instruction pointer (RIP), effectively skipping the `ud2` instruction

This technique makes static analysis more difficult and can confuse debuggers that don't handle the signal properly.

### Password Validation Logic
The program expects exactly one command-line argument (the password) and validates it through multiple checks:

1. **Argument Count**: Checks if argc == 2
2. **Password Length**: Verifies the password is exactly 12 characters long using `strlen()`
3. **Sequential Validation**: The password is checked in 4 parts, each 3 characters long:
   - Position 0-2: Must match "Itz"
   - Position 3-5: Must match "_0n"
   - Position 6-8: Must match "Ly_"
   - Position 9-11: Must match "UD2"

### Key Findings
- The password components are stored separately in the `.rodata` section
- Each check uses `strncmp()` with a length of 3
- The complete password is: **Itz_0nLy_UD2**
- The flag format follows HTB convention: `HTB{password}`

### Interesting Observations
1. The password "Itz_0nLy_UD2" is a play on words - "It's only UD2", referring to the anti-debugging technique used
2. The program doesn't actually make decompilation significantly harder - the symbols are not stripped and the logic is straightforward
3. The `ud2` instructions serve more as a learning exercise about signal handling than a serious protection mechanism

## Solution
Running the program with the correct password yields the flag:
```
./behindthescenes "Itz_0nLy_UD2"
> HTB{Itz_0nLy_UD2}
```

## Flag
**HTB{Itz_0nLy_UD2}**
