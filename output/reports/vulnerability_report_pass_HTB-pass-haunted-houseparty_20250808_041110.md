# HTB Haunted Houseparty: pass Binary Reverse Engineering Report

## Overview
All the coolest ghosts are attending a Haunted Houseparty. The provided binary `pass` gates entry behind a password check. The goal is to reverse the program to obtain the flag in the form `HTB{...}`.

## Plan
- Set up Kali sandbox and locate `pass`.
- Recon the binary: type, linkage, symbols, embedded strings.
- Execute to observe runtime behavior.
- Use static/dynamic hints to recover the password and trigger the success path.
- Capture the flag and document findings.

## Environment and Artifact
- OS: Kali Linux (containerized sandbox)
- Target: `/home/user/pass`

## Step 1: Binary Reconnaissance
Identify the file type and peek at embedded strings and symbols.

```bash
file pass
strings -n 6 ./pass | head -n 50
```

Key findings:
- ELF 64-bit PIE, dynamically linked, not stripped.
- Imports: `fgets`, `strcmp`, `printf`, `strchr` â€” typical for simple input/compare logic.
- Human-readable strings include prompts and a conspicuous password-looking string:
  - "Welcome to the [SPOOKIEST] party of the year."
  - "Before we let you in, you'll need to give us the password:"
  - "Welcome inside!"
  - "You're not a real ghost; clear off!"
  - `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5` (likely the password)

## Step 2: Dynamic Behavior
Run the program with an incorrect password:

```bash
./pass <<EOF
foo
EOF
```

Output:
```
Welcome to the SPOOKIEST party of the year.
Before we let you in, you'll need to give us the password: You're not a real ghost; clear off!
```

Run with the suspected password from strings:

```bash
./pass <<EOF
s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5
EOF
```

Output:
```
Welcome to the SPOOKIEST party of the year.
Before we let you in, you'll need to give us the password: Welcome inside!
HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}
```

## Logic Summary
- The program reads a line from stdin (likely via `fgets`).
- It compares the input to a hardcoded password using `strcmp`.
- On success, it prints a welcome message and the flag.
- On failure, it prints a rejection message.

Because the binary is not stripped and embeds the password as a cleartext string, a simple `strings` inspection reveals the necessary input to reach the success path.

## Conclusion
- Password: `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`
- Flag: `HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}`

This challenge highlights the risk of embedding secrets directly in binaries and the ease with which static analysis tools can extract them when binaries are not stripped or obfuscated.
