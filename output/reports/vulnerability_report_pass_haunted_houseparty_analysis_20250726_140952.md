# Reverse Engineering Analysis: "pass" Binary

## Challenge Overview
**Challenge Name:** Haunted Houseparty  
**Binary:** pass  
**Flag:** `HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}`

## Executive Summary
The "pass" binary is a simple password-protected program that validates user input against a hardcoded password and reveals a flag upon successful authentication. The challenge demonstrates basic reverse engineering techniques for analyzing unobfuscated binaries.

## Technical Analysis

### Binary Information
- **File Type:** ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64
- **Architecture:** x86-64
- **Dynamically linked:** Yes
- **Stripped:** No (symbols present)
- **Security Features:** Stack canary protection enabled

### Program Flow Analysis

#### 1. Initial Execution
The program presents a themed welcome message:
```
Welcome to the SPOOKIEST party of the year.
Before we let you in, you'll need to give us the password:
```

#### 2. Password Validation
The program uses `fgets()` to read user input (up to 128 characters) and performs the following operations:
- Removes newline character using `strchr()` and null-termination
- Compares input against hardcoded password using `strcmp()`
- Password location: `.rodata` section at offset 0x2080

#### 3. Authentication Logic
```c
if (strcmp(user_input, "s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5") == 0) {
    // Success path - reveal flag
} else {
    // Failure path - deny access
}
```

### Flag Construction Mechanism

Upon successful authentication, the program constructs the flag through a loop that:
1. Iterates 26 times (0x19 + 1)
2. Reads 4-byte integers from the `parts` array in the `.data` section
3. Converts each integer to a character and builds the flag string
4. Displays the constructed flag using `puts()`

### Memory Layout Analysis

#### .rodata Section (String Constants)
- **0x2008:** Welcome message with ANSI color codes
- **0x2040:** Password prompt
- **0x2080:** Hardcoded password: `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`
- **0x20a2:** Success message: "Welcome inside!"
- **0x20b8:** Failure message: "You're not a real ghost; clear off!"

#### .data Section (Flag Parts Array)
Starting at offset 0x4060, the `parts` array contains 26 4-byte integers representing ASCII values:
```
48 54 42 7b 75 6e 30 62 66 75 35 63 34 74 33 64 5f 35 74 72 31 6e 67 35 7d
H  T  B  {  u  n  0  b  f  u  5  c  4  t  3  d  _  5  t  r  1  n  g  5  }
```

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Security Weaknesses
1. **Hardcoded Credentials:** Password stored in plaintext in the binary
2. **No Obfuscation:** All strings and logic easily readable
3. **Static Analysis Vulnerability:** Flag construction logic visible in disassembly
4. **Information Disclosure:** Success/failure messages provide feedback for brute force attempts

### Exploitation Method
The challenge can be solved through multiple approaches:

#### Method 1: String Analysis (Used)
```bash
strings pass | grep -E "^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$" | head -10
```
Reveals the password: `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`

#### Method 2: Static Analysis
Disassemble the binary and analyze the `strcmp()` call to identify the comparison string.

#### Method 3: Dynamic Analysis
Use debuggers like GDB to set breakpoints and examine memory during execution.

## Solution Steps

1. **Binary Analysis:**
   ```bash
   file pass
   strings pass
   ```

2. **Password Discovery:**
   Found hardcoded password in strings output: `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`

3. **Authentication:**
   ```bash
   ./pass
   # Enter: s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5
   ```

4. **Flag Retrieval:**
   Program outputs: `HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}`

## Recommendations

For developers creating similar challenges:
1. Implement string obfuscation techniques
2. Use dynamic password generation
3. Add anti-debugging measures
4. Employ code packing/encryption
5. Implement decoy strings and false flags

## Conclusion

This challenge serves as an excellent introduction to binary reverse engineering, demonstrating fundamental concepts like:
- String analysis with the `strings` command
- Understanding program flow through disassembly
- Memory layout analysis
- Static vs. dynamic analysis approaches

The flag `HTB{un0bfu5c4t3d_5tr1ng5}` appropriately reflects the straightforward nature of this reverse engineering challenge, where unobfuscated strings made the solution readily accessible through basic static analysis techniques.
