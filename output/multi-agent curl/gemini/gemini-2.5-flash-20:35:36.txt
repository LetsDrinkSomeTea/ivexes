> - appveyor: rewrite batch in PowerShell + CI improvements
> 
>   1. Rewrite in PowerShell:
> 
>   - rewrite MS-DOS batch build script in PowerShell.
>   - move some bash operations into native PowerShell.
>   - fixups for PowerShell insisting on failure when a command outputs
>     something to stderr.
>   - fix to actually run `curl -V` after every build.
>     (and exclude ARM64 builds.)
>   - also say why we skipped `curl -V` if we had to skip.
>   - fix CMake warnings about unused configuration variables, by adapting
>     these dynamically for build cases.
>   - dedupe OpenSSL path into a variable.
>   - disable `test1451` failing with a warning anyway due to missing python
>     impacket. (after trying and failing to install impacket)
>     PowerShell promotes these warnings to errors by PowerShell. We can also
>     suppress they wholesale if they start causing issues in the future,
>     like we already to with `autoreconf` and `./configure`.
> 
>   PowerShell is better than MS-DOS batches, so the hope is this makes it
>   easier to extend and maintain the AppVeyor build logic. POSIX/bash isn't
>   supported inline by AppVeyor on Windows build machines, but we are okay
>   to keep it in an external script, so it's also an option.
> 
>   2. CI improvements:
> 
>   - enable tests for a "unity" build job.
>   - speed-up CI initialization by using shallow clones of the curl repo.
>   - speed-up CMake MSVC jobs with `TrackFileAccess=false`.
>   - enable parallelism in `VisualStudioSolution` builds.
>   - display CMake version before builds.
>   - always show the CPU in job names.
>   - tell which jobs are build-only in job names.
>   - move `TESTING:` value next to `DISABLED_TESTS:` in two jobs.
>   - add `config.log` (autotools) to dumped logs (need to enable manually).
> 
>   3. Style:
> 
>   - use single-quotes in YAML like we do in other CI YAML files.
>     It also allows to drop quoting characters and lighter to write/read.
>     (keep double quotes for PowerShell strings needing expansion.)

< 
< - tests: increase sws timeout for more robust testing
< 
<   - for https CONNECT forwarding, this was fixed at 5 seconds

< - http2: move HTTP/2 stream vars into local context
< 
<   - remove NGHTTP2 members of `struct HTTP`
<   - add `void *h2_ctx` to `struct HTTP`

< - proxy: http2 proxy tunnel implementation
< 
<   - currently only on debug build and when env variable
<     CURL_PROXY_TUNNEL_H2 is present.
<   - will ALPN negotiate with the proxy server and switch
<     tunnel filter based on the protocol negotiated.
<   - http/1.1 tunnel code moved into cf-h1-proxy.[ch]
<   - http/2 tunnel code implemented in cf-h2-proxy.[ch]
<   - tunnel start and ALPN set remains in http_proxy.c
<   - moving all haproxy related code into cf-haproxy.[ch]
< 
<   VTLS changes
<   - SSL filters rely solely on the "alpn" specification they
<     are created with and no longer check conn->bits.tls_enable_alpn.
<   - checks on which ALPN specification to use (or none at all) are
<     done in vtls.c when creating the filter.

< 
<   - fix HTTP/3 support detection with OpenSSL/quictls built with ZLIB.

< 
<   - fix HTTP/3 support detection with OpenSSL/quictls/LibreSSL and `ld`
<     linker on Windows.
< 
<   - fix HTTP/3 support detection with wolfSSL to automatically add
<     `ws2_32` to the lib list on Windows. For all linkers.
< 
<   - reposition ZLIB (and other compression) detection _after_ TLS
<     detection, but before calling HTTP/3-support detection via
<     `CheckQuicSupportInOpenSSL`.
< 
<     May be a regression from ebef55a61df0094b9790710a42f63c48e7de3c13
<     May fix #10832 (Reported-by: Micah Snyder)
< 
<     This also seems to fix an odd case, where OpenSSL/quictls is correctly
<     detected, but its header path is not set while compiling, breaking
<     build at `src/curl_ntlm_core.c`. Reason for this remains undiscovered.
< 
<   - satisfy "picky" linkers such as `ld` with MinGW, that are highly
<     sensitive to lib order, by also adding brotli to the beginning of the
<     lib list.
< 
<   - satisfy "picky" linkers by adding certain Windows systems libs to
<     the lib list for OpenSSL/LibreSSL. (Might need additional ones for
<     other forks, such as `pthread` for BoringSSL.)
< 
<   Note: It'd make sense to _always_ add `ws2_32`, `crypt32` (except
<   Windows App targets perhaps?), `bcrypt` (except old-mingw!) on Windows
<   at this point. They are almost always required, and if some aren't,

<   - various methods for reading from and writing to it.
<   - `peek` support to get access to buffered data without copy
<   - `pass` support to allow buffer flushing on write if it becomes full
<   - use case: IO buffers for dynamic reads and writes that do not blow up
<   - distinct from `dynbuf` in that:
<     - it maintains a read position
<     - writes on a full bufq return CURLE_AGAIN instead of nuking itself
<   - Init options:
<     - SOFT_LIMIT: allow writes into a full bufq
<     - NO_SPARES: free empty chunks right away
<   - a `bufc_pool` that can keep a number of spare chunks to
<     be shared between different `bufq` instances
< 
<   Adding `dynhds`:
<   - a straightforward list of name+value pairs as used for HTTP headers
<   - headers can be appended dynamically
<   - headers can be removed again
<   - headers can be replaced
<   - headers can be looked up
<   - http/1.1 formatting into a `dynbuf`
<   - configured at init() with limits on header counts and total string
<     sizes
<   - use case: pass a HTTP request or response around without being version
<     specific

<   As they are not driving transfers or any socket activity, the main loop

<   They are instead only held in their own separate lists.
< 
<   'data->multi' is kept a pointer to the multi handle as long as the easy

<   pending/msgsent lists. It needs to know which multi handle it belongs
<   to, if for example curl_easy_cleanup() is called before the handle is
<   removed from the multi handle.
< 
<   Alll 'data->multi' pointers of handles still part of the multi handle

<   - a reset transfer (HTTP/2 RST) did not always lead to the proper

<     of a successful transfer
<   - test_05_02 was able to trigger this condition with increased transfer
<     count. The simulated response errors did not carry a 'Content-Length'
<     so only proper RST handling could detect the abort
<   - When doing such transfers in parallel, a connection could enter the
<     state where
<     a) it had been closed (GOAWAY received)
<     b) the RST had not been "seen" for the transfer yet
<     or c) the GOAWAY announced an error and the last successful

> 
>   1. Rewrite in PowerShell:
> 
>   - rewrite MS-DOS batch build script in PowerShell.
>   - move some bash operations into native PowerShell.
>   - fixups for PowerShell insisting on failure when a command outputs
>     something to stderr.
>   - fix to actually run `curl -V` after every build.
>     (and exclude ARM64 builds.)
>   - also say why we skipped `curl -V` if we had to skip.
>   - fix CMake warnings about unused configuration variables, by adapting
>     these dynamically for build cases.
>   - dedupe OpenSSL path into a variable.
>   - disable `test1451` failing with a warning anyway due to missing python
>     impacket. (after trying and failing to install impacket)
>     PowerShell promotes these warnings to errors by PowerShell. We can also
>     suppress they wholesale if they start causing issues in the future,
>     like we already to with `autoreconf` and `./configure`.
> 
>   PowerShell is better than MS-DOS batches, so the hope is this makes it
>   easier to extend and maintain the AppVeyor build logic. POSIX/bash isn't
>   supported inline by AppVeyor on Windows build machines, but we are okay
>   to keep it in an external script, so it's also an option.

>   2. CI improvements:
> 
>   - enable tests for a "unity" build job.
>   - speed-up CI initialization by using shallow clones of the curl repo.
>   - speed-up CMake MSVC jobs with `TrackFileAccess=false`.
>   - enable parallelism in `VisualStudioSolution` builds.
>   - display CMake version before builds.
>   - always show the CPU in job names.
>   - tell which jobs are build-only in job names.
>   - move `TESTING:` value next to `DISABLED_TESTS:` in two jobs.
>   - add `config.log` (autotools) to dumped logs (need to enable manually).
> 
>   3. Style:
> 
>   - use single-quotes in YAML like we do in other CI YAML files.
>     It also allows to drop quoting characters and lighter to write/read.
>     (keep double quotes for PowerShell strings needing expansion.)

< 
<   - fix HTTP/3 support detection with wolfSSL to automatically add

< 
<   - reposition ZLIB (and other compression) detection _after_ TLS

< 
<     This also seems to fix an odd case, where OpenSSL/quictls is correctly
<     detected, but its header path is not set while compiling, breaking
<     build at `src/curl_ntlm_core.c`. Reason for this remains undiscovered.
<

< 
<   - satisfy "picky" linkers by adding certain Windows systems libs to
<     the lib list for OpenSSL/LibreSSL. (Might need additional ones for
<     other forks, such as `pthread` for BoringSSL.)
< 
<   Note: It'd make sense to _always_ add `ws2_32`, `crypt32` (except
<   Windows App targets perhaps?), `bcrypt` (except old-mingw!) on Windows
<   at this point. They are almost always required, and if some aren't,

< 
<   Adding `bufq`:

<   - various methods for reading from and writing to it.
<   - `peek` support to get access to buffered data without copy
<   - `pass` support to allow buffer flushing on write if it becomes full
<   - use case: IO buffers for dynamic reads and writes that do not blow up
<   - distinct from `dynbuf` in that:
<     - it maintains a read position
<     - writes on a full bufq return CURLE_AGAIN instead of nuking itself
<   - Init options:
<     - SOFT_LIMIT: allow writes into a full bufq
<     - NO_SPARES: free empty chunks right away
<   - a `bufc_pool` that can keep a number of spare chunks to
<     be shared between different `bufq` instances
< 
<   Adding `dynhds`:
<   - a straightforward list of name+value pairs as used for HTTP headers
<   - headers can be appended dynamically
<   - headers can be removed again
<   - headers can be replaced
<   - headers can be looked up
<   - http/1.1 formatting into a `dynbuf`
<   - configured at init() with limits on header counts and total string

<   to, if for example curl_easy_cleanup() is called before the handle is
<   removed from the multi handle.
< 
<   Alll 'data->multi' pointers of handles still part of the multi handle
<   gets cleared by curl_multi_cleanup() which "orphans" all previously

< 
< - tests: make first.c the same for both lib tests and unit tests
< 
<   The only difference used to be global variable used in unittest tests.
<   After cb7ed5a removed individual flag overrides for the unittests, first.c
<   was no longer recompiled for unit tests to include the flag, so whether it

< - headers: make curl_easy_header and nextheader return different buffers
< 
<   By letting curl_easy_header() and curl_easy_nextheader() store the
<   header data in their own struct storage when they return a pointer to
<   it, it makes it possible for applications to use them both in a loop.
<   Like the curl tool does.

< Stefan Eissing (6 Mar 2023)
< 
< - http2: fix handling of RST and GOAWAY to recognize partial transfers
< 
<   - a reset transfer (HTTP/2 RST) did not always lead to the proper
<     error message on receiving its response, leading to wrong reports
<     of a successful transfer
<   - test_05_02 was able to trigger this condition with increased transfer
<     count. The simulated response errors did not carry a 'Content-Length'
<     so only proper RST handling could detect the abort
<   - When doing such transfers in parallel, a connection could enter the
<     state where
<     a) it had been closed (GOAWAY received)
<     b) the RST had not been "seen" for the transfer yet
<     or c) the GOAWAY announced an error and the last successful
<     stream id was not checked against ongoing transfers
< 
<   Closes #10693
< 
< - tests: use dynamic ports numbers in pytest suite
< 
<   - necessary ports are bound at start of test suite and then
<     given to server fixtures for use.
<   - this make parallel use of pytest (in separate directories),
<     practically safe for use as OS tend to not reuse such port numbers
<     for a while
< 
<   Closes #10692
< 
< - connect: fix time_connect and time_appconnect timer statistics
< 
<   - time_connect was not updated when the overall connection failed,
<     e.g. when SSL verification was unsuccessful, refs #10670
<   - rework gather those values to interrogate involved filters,
<     also from all eyeballing attempts, to report the maximum of
<     those values.
<   - added 3 test cases in test_06 to check reported values on
<     successful, partially failed and totally failed connections.

< 
< - rand: use arc4random as fallback when available
< 
<   Normally curl uses cryptographically strong random provided by the
<   selected SSL backend. If compiled without SSL support, a naive built-in
<   function was used instead.
< 
<   Generally this was okay, but it will result in some downsides for non-
<   SSL builds, such as predictable temporary file names.
< 
<   This change ensures that arc4random will be used instead, if available.

< 
< Grisha Levit (6 Mar 2023)
< 
< - tool: dump headers even if file is write-only
< 
<   The fixes in #10079 brought a (seemingly unrelated) change of open mode
<   from `wb`/`ab` to `wb+`/`ab+` for the headerfile. This makes it no
<   longer possible to write the header file to e.g. a pipe, like:
< 
<       curl -D >(grep ...) file:///dev/null
< 
<   Which presently results in `Warning: Failed to open /dev/fd/63`
< 
<   See #10079

>   The curl tool that is shipped as an integrated component of Windows 10 and
>   Windows 11 is managed by Microsoft. If you were to delete the file or
>   replace it with a newer version downloaded from https://curl.se/windows,
>   then Windows Update will cease to work on your system.
> 
>   There is no way to independently force an upgrade of the curl.exe that is
>   part of Windows other than through the regular Windows update process. There
>   is also nothing the curl project itself can do about this, since this is
>   managed and controlled entirely by Microsoft as owners of the operating
>   system.
> 
>   You can always download and install the latest version of curl for Windows
>   from https://curl.se/windows into a separate location.

+- socks: return error if hostname too long for remote resolve
+
+  Prior to this change the state machine attempted to change the remote
+  resolve to a local resolve if the hostname was longer than 255
+  characters. Unfortunately that did not work as intended and caused a
+  security issue.
+
+  Bug: https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html

+Stefan Eissing (10 Oct 2023)
+
+- CI: remove slowed-network tests
+
+  - remove these tests as they are currently not reliable in our CI
+    setups.
+
+  curl handles the test cases, but CI sometimes fails on these due to
+  additional conditions. Rather than mix them in, an additional CI job
+  will be added in the future that is specific to them.

+- libcurl-env-dbg.3: move debug variables from libcurl-env.3
+
+  - Move documentation of libcurl environment variables used only in debug
+    builds from libcurl-env into a separate document libcurl-env-dbg.
+
+  - Document more debug environment variables.
+
+  Previously undocumented or missing a description:
+
+  CURL_ALTSVC_HTTP, CURL_DBG_SOCK_WBLOCK, CURL_DBG_SOCK_WPARTIAL,
+  CURL_DBG_QUIC_WBLOCK, CURL_DEBUG, CURL_DEBUG_SIZE, CURL_GETHOSTNAME,

+- build: do not publish `HAVE_BORINGSSL`, `HAVE_AWSLC` macros
+
+  Syncing this up with CMake.
+
+  Source code uses the built-in `OPENSSL_IS_AWSLC` and
+  `OPENSSL_IS_BORINSSL` macros to detect BoringSSL and AWS-LC. No help is
+  necessary from the build tools.
+
+  The one use of `HAVE_BORINGSSL` in the source turned out to be no longer
+  necessary for warning-free BoringSSL + Schannel builds. Ref: #1610 #2634
+
+  autotools detects this anyway for display purposes.
+  CMake detects this to decide whether to use the BoringSSL-specific
+  crypto lib with ngtcp2. It detects AWS-LC, but doesn't use the detection
+  result just yet (planned in #12066).

+- CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION.3: warn about internal handles
+
+  - Warn that the user's debug callback may be called with the handle
+    parameter set to an internal handle.
+
+  Without this warning the user may assume that the only handles their
+  debug callback receives are the easy handles on which they set
+  CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION.
+
+  This is a follow-up to f8cee8cc which changed DoH handles to inherit
+  the debug callback function set in the user's easy handle. As a result
+  those handles are now passed to the user's debug callback function.

+- tests: fix a race condition in ftp server disconnect
+
+  If a client disconnected and reconnected quickly, before the ftp server
+  had a chance to respond, the protocol message/ack (ping/pong) sequence
+  got out of sync, causing messages sent to the old client to be delivered
+  to the new.  A disconnect must now be acknowledged and intermediate
+  requests thrown out until it is, which ensures that such synchronization
+  problems can't occur. This problem could affect ftp, pop3, imap and smtp

+
+  - Return CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT if IDN hostname cannot be converted from
+    UTF-8 to UTF-16.
+
+  Prior to this change a failed conversion erroneously returned CURLE_OK
+  which meant 'decoded' pointer (what would normally point to the
+  punycode) would not be written to, remain NULL and be dereferenced
+  causing an access violation.

+- base64: also build for curl
+
+  Since the tool itself now uses the base64 code using the curlx way, it

+
+  ftpserver.pl correctly cleans up spawned server processes,

+- github/labeler: improve labeler matches
+
+- test574: add a timeout to the test
+
+  This one hangs occasionally, so this will speed up a test run and allow
+  logs to be seen when it does.
+
+  Closes #12025
+
+- tests: propagate errors in libtests
+
+  Use the test macros to automatically propagate some errors, and check
+  and log others while running the tests. This can help in debugging
+  exactly why a test has failed.
+
+- tests: set --expect100-timeout to improve test reliability
+
+  On an overloaded server, the default 1 second timeout can go by without
+  the test server having a chance to respond with the expected headers,
+  causing tests to fail. Increase the 1 second timeout to 99 seconds so
+  this failure mode is no longer a problem on test 1129. Some other tests
+  already set a high value, but make them consistently 99 seconds so if
+  something goes wrong the test is stalled for less time.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- CI: ignore the "flaky" and "timing-dependent" test results in CMake
+
+  This was already done for automake builds but CMake builds were missed.
+  Test 1086 actually causes the test harness to crash with:
+
+  Warning: unable to close filehandle DWRITE properly: Broken pipe at C:/projec
+  ts/curl/tests/ftpserver.pl line 527
+
+  Rather than fix it now, this change leaves test 1086 entirely skipped on
+  those builds that show this problem.

+- cmake: fix unity with Windows Unicode + TrackMemory
+
+  Found the root cause of the startup crash in unity builds with Unicode
+  and TrackMemory enabled at the same time.
+
+  We must make sure that the `memdebug.h` header doesn't apply to
+  `lib/curl_multibyte.c` (as even noted in a comment there.) In unity
+  builds all headers apply to all sources, including `curl_multibyte.c`.
+  This probably resulted in an infinite loop on startup.
+
+  Exclude this source from unity compilation with TrackMemory enabled,
+  in both libcurl and curl tool. Enable unity mode for a debug Unicode
+  CI job to keep it tested. Also delete the earlier workaround that
+  fully disabled unity for affected builds.

+- cmake: disable unity mode with Windows Unicode + TrackMemory
+
+  "TrackMemory" is `ENABLE_DEBUG=ON` (aka `ENABLE_CURLDEBUG=ON`,
+  aka `-DCURLDEBUG`).
+
+  There is an issue with memory tracking and Unicode when built in "unity"
+  mode, which results in the curl tool crashing right on startup, even
+  without any command-line option. Interestingly this doesn't happen under
+  WINE (at least on the system I tested this on), but consistenly happens
+  on real Windows machines. Crash is 0xC0000374 heap corruption. Both
+  shared and static curl executables are affected.
+
+  This limitation probably won't hit too many people, but it remains
+  a TODO to find and fix the root cause and drop this workaround.

+- appveyor: rewrite batch in PowerShell + CI improvements
+
+  1. Rewrite in PowerShell:
+
+  - rewrite MS-DOS batch build script in PowerShell.
+  - move some bash operations into native PowerShell.
+  - fixups for PowerShell insisting on failure when a command outputs
+    something to stderr.
+  - fix to actually run `curl -V` after every build.
+    (and exclude ARM64 builds.)
+  - also say why we skipped `curl -V` if we had to skip.
+  - fix CMake warnings about unused configuration variables, by adapting
+    these dynamically for build cases.
+  - dedupe OpenSSL path into a variable.
+  - disable `test1451` failing with a warning anyway due to missing python
+    impacket. (after trying and failing to install impacket)
+    PowerShell promotes these warnings to errors by PowerShell. We can also
+    suppress they wholesale if they start causing issues in the future,
+    like we already to with `autoreconf` and `./configure`.
+
+  PowerShell is better than MS-DOS batches, so the hope is this makes it
+  easier to extend and maintain the AppVeyor build logic. POSIX/bash isn't
+  supported inline by AppVeyor on Windows build machines, but we are okay
+  to keep it in an external script, so it's also an option.
+
+  2. CI improvements:
+
+  - enable tests for a "unity" build job.
+  - speed-up CI initialization by using shallow clones of the curl repo.
+  - speed-up CMake MSVC jobs with `TrackFileAccess=false`.
+  - enable parallelism in `VisualStudioSolution` builds.
+  - display CMake version before builds.
+  - always show the CPU in job names.
+  - tell which jobs are build-only in job names.
+  - move `TESTING:` value next to `DISABLED_TESTS:` in two jobs.
+  - add `config.log` (autotools) to dumped logs (need to enable manually).
+
+  3. Style:
+
+  - use single-quotes in YAML like we do in other CI YAML files.
+    It also allows to drop quoting characters and lighter to write/read.
+    (keep double quotes for PowerShell strings needing expansion.)
+
+  Closes #11999

+- cmake: fix `HAVE_LDAP_SSL`, `HAVE_LDAP_URL_PARSE` on non-Windows
+
+  - set `HAVE_LDAP_URL_PARSE` if `ldap_url_parse` function exists.
+    Before this patch we set it based it on the presence of `stricmp`,
+    which correctly enabled it on e.g. Windows, but was inaccurate for
+    other platforms.
+
+  - always set `HAVE_LDAP_SSL` if an LDAP backend is detected and
+    LDAPS is not explicitly disabled. This mimics autotools behaviour.
+    Previously we set it only for Windows LDAP. After this fix, LDAPS is
+    correctly enabled in default macOS builds.
+
+  - enable LDAP[S] for a CMake macOS CI job. Target OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)
+    to avoid deprecation warnings for LDAP API.
+
+  - always detect `HAVE_LDAP_SSL_H`, even with LDAPS explicitly disabled.
+    This doesn't make much sense, but let's do it to sync behaviour with
+    autotools.
+
+  - fix benign typo in variable name.

+
+  autotools always runs all 3 probes for non-fast-tracked systems and
+  enables this feature if any one of them was successful. To save
+  configuration time,  CMake stops at the first successful check.
+
+  OpenBSD is not fast-tracked and then gets blocklisted as a generic BSD

+
+  - list the DLLs and EXEs present after the builds.

+- tool: use our own stderr variable
+
+  Earlier this year we changed our own stderr variable to use the standard

+  standard `stderr` symbol via the preprocessor. This in turn didn't play
+  well with unity builds and caused curl tool to crash or stay silent due
+  to an uninitialized stderr. This was a hard to find issue, fixed by
+  manually breaking out one file from the unity sources.
+
+  To avoid two these two tricks, this patch implements a different
+  solution: Restore using our own local variable for our stderr output and
+  leave `stderr` as-is. To avoid using `stderr` by mistake, add a
+  `checksrc` rule (based on logic we already used in lib for `strerror`)
+  that detects any `stderr` use in `src` and points to using our own
+  variable instead: `tool_stderr`.

+  CID 1024653:  Integer handling issues  (SIGN_EXTENSION)
+
+  Suspicious implicit sign extension: "src[i]" with type "unsigned char
+  const" (8 bits, unsigned) is promoted in "src[i] << (1 - i % 2 << 3)" to
+  type "int" (32 bits, signed), then sign-extended to type "unsigned long"
+  (64 bits, unsigned).  If "src[i] << (1 - i % 2 << 3)" is greater than
+  0x7FFFFFFF, the upper bits of the result will all be 1.
+
+  111         words[i/2] |= (src[i] << ((1 - (i % 2)) << 3));
+
+  The value will not be greater than 0x7FFFFFFF so this still cannot
+  happen.
+
+  Also, switch to ints here instead of longs. The values stored are 16 bit
+  so at least no need to use 64 bit variables. Also, longs are 32 bit on
+  some platforms so this logic still needs to work with 32 bits.

+- tftpd: always use curl's own tftp.h
+
+  Using the system's provided arpa/tftp.h and optimizing, GCC 12 detects
+  and reports a stringop-overread warning:
+
+  tftpd.c: In function ‘write_behind.isra’:
+  tftpd.c:485:12: warning: ‘write’ reading between 1 and 2147483647 bytes f

+        |                              ^~~~~~~
+
+  This occurs because writebuf points to this field and the latter

+
+  This commit always uses curl's own version of tftp.h where the

+- tests: increase the default server logs lock timeout
+
+  This timeout is used to wait for the server to finish writing its logs
+  before checking them against the expected values. An overloaded machine
+  could take more than the two seconds previously allocated, so increase
+  the timeout to 5 seconds.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+  Closes #11834
+
+- tests: increase TEST_HANG_TIMEOUT in two tests
+
+  These tests had a 5 second timeout compared to 60 seconds for all other
+  tests. Make these consistent with the others for more reliability on
+  heavily-loaded machines.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- test1056: disable on Windows
+
+  This test relies on the IPv6 scope field being ignored when connecting to
+  ipv6-localhost (i.e. [::1%259999] is treated as [::1]). Maybe this is a bit
+  dodgy, but it works on all our test platforms except Windows. This
+  test was disabled manually on all Windows CI builds already, so instead
+  add an incompatible feature and precheck so it's skipped on Windows
+  everywhere automatically.
+
+- test587: add a slight delay after test
+
+  This test is designed to connect to the server, then immediately send a
+  few bytes and disconnect. In some situations, such as on a loaded
+  server, this doesn't give the server enough time to write its lock file
+  before its existence is checked. The test harness then fails to find the
+  server's input log file (because it hasn't been written yet) and fails
+  the test. By adding a short delay after the test, the HTTP server has
+  enough time to write its lock file which gives itself more time to write
+  its remaining files.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- tests: stop overriding the lock timeout
+
+  These tests reduce the server lock wait timeout which can increase
+  flakiness on loaded machines. Since this is merely an optimization,
+  eliminate them in favour of reliability.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- tests: add some --expect100-timeout to reduce timing dependencies
+
+  These tests can fail when the test machine is so slow that the test HTTP
+  server didn't get a chance to complete before the client's one second
+  100-continue timeout triggered. Increase that 1 second to 999 seconds so
+  this situation doesn't happen.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- test661: return from test early in case of curl error
+
+- tests: add the timing-dependent keyword on several tests
+
+  These are ones likely to fail on heavily-loaded machines that alter the
+  normal test timing. Most of these tests already had the flaky keyword
+  since this condition makes them more likely to fail on CI.
+
+- test1592: greatly increase the maximum test timeout
+
+  It was too short to be reliable on heavily loaded CI machines, and
+  as a fail-safe only, it didn't need to be short.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- test: minor test cleanups
+
+  Remove an obsolete block of code in tests 2032 & 576.
+  Add a comment in test 1474.
+
+- tests: quadruple the %FTPTIME2 and %FTPTIME3 timeouts
+
+  This gives more of a margin for error when running on overloaded CI
+  servers.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- tests: improve SLOWDOWN test reliability by reducing sent data
+
+  These tests are run in SLOWDOWN mode which adds a 10 msec delay after
+  each character output, which means it takes at least 1.6 seconds (and
+  320 kernel calls) just to get through the long welcome banner. On an
+  overloaded system, this can end up taking much more than 1.6 seconds,
+  and even more than the 7 or 16 second curl timeout that the tests rely
+  on, causing them to fail. Reducing the size of the welcome banner drops
+  the total number of characters sent before the transfer starts by more
+  than half, which reduces the opportunity for test-breaking slowdowns by
+  the same amount.

-- http2: move HTTP/2 stream vars into local context
-
-  - remove NGHTTP2 members of `struct HTTP`
-  - add `void *h2_ctx` to `struct HTTP`

-- proxy: http2 proxy tunnel implementation
-
-  - currently only on debug build and when env variable
-    CURL_PROXY_TUNNEL_H2 is present.
-  - will ALPN negotiate with the proxy server and switch
-    tunnel filter based on the protocol negotiated.
-  - http/1.1 tunnel code moved into cf-h1-proxy.[ch]
-  - http/2 tunnel code implemented in cf-h2-proxy.[ch]
-  - tunnel start and ALPN set remains in http_proxy.c
-  - moving all haproxy related code into cf-haproxy.[ch]
-
-  VTLS changes
-  - SSL filters rely solely on the "alpn" specification they
-    are created with and no longer check conn->bits.tls_enable_alpn.
-  - checks on which ALPN specification to use (or none at all) are
-    done in vtls.c when creating the filter.
-
-  Testing
-  - added a nghttpx forward proxy to the pytest setup that
-    speaks HTTP/2 and forwards all requests to the Apache httpd
-    forward proxy server.
-  - extending test coverage in test_10 cases
-  - adding proxy tests for direct/tunnel h1/h2 use of basic auth.
-  - adding test for http/1.1 and h2 proxy tunneling to pytest

-
-  scorecard improvements
-  - do not start caddy when only httpd is requested
-  - allow curl -v to stderr file on --curl-verbose

-- cmake: picky-linker fixes for openssl, ZLIB, H3 and more
-
-  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with OpenSSL/quictls built with ZLIB.
-    (Requires curl be built with ZLIB option also.)
-
-  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with OpenSSL/quictls/LibreSSL and `ld`
-    linker on Windows.
-
-  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with wolfSSL to automatically add
-    `ws2_32` to the lib list on Windows. For all linkers.
-
-  - reposition ZLIB (and other compression) detection _after_ TLS
-    detection, but before calling HTTP/3-support detection via
-    `CheckQuicSupportInOpenSSL`.
-
-    May be a regression from ebef55a61df0094b9790710a42f63c48e7de3c13
-    May fix #10832 (Reported-by: Micah Snyder)
-
-    This also seems to fix an odd case, where OpenSSL/quictls is correctly
-    detected, but its header path is not set while compiling, breaking
-    build at `src/curl_ntlm_core.c`. Reason for this remains undiscovered.
-
-  - satisfy "picky" linkers such as `ld` with MinGW, that are highly
-    sensitive to lib order, by also adding brotli to the beginning of the
-    lib list.
-
-  - satisfy "picky" linkers by adding certain Windows systems libs to
-    the lib list for OpenSSL/LibreSSL. (Might need additional ones for
-    other forks, such as `pthread` for BoringSSL.)
-
-  Note: It'd make sense to _always_ add `ws2_32`, `crypt32` (except
-  Windows App targets perhaps?), `bcrypt` (except old-mingw!) on Windows
-  at this point. They are almost always required, and if some aren't,
-  they are ignored by the linker with no effect on final binaries.

-- lib: add `bufq` and `dynhds`
-
-  Adding `bufq`:
-  - at init() time configured to hold up to `n` chunks of `m` bytes each.
-  - various methods for reading from and writing to it.
-  - `peek` support to get access to buffered data without copy
-  - `pass` support to allow buffer flushing on write if it becomes full
-  - use case: IO buffers for dynamic reads and writes that do not blow up
-  - distinct from `dynbuf` in that:
-    - it maintains a read position
-    - writes on a full bufq return CURLE_AGAIN instead of nuking itself
-  - Init options:
-    - SOFT_LIMIT: allow writes into a full bufq
-    - NO_SPARES: free empty chunks right away
-  - a `bufc_pool` that can keep a number of spare chunks to
-    be shared between different `bufq` instances
-
-  Adding `dynhds`:
-  - a straightforward list of name+value pairs as used for HTTP headers
-  - headers can be appended dynamically
-  - headers can be removed again
-  - headers can be replaced
-  - headers can be looked up
-  - http/1.1 formatting into a `dynbuf`
-  - configured at init() with limits on header counts and total string
-    sizes
-  - use case: pass a HTTP request or response around without being version

-
-  'data->multi' is kept a pointer to the multi handle as long as the easy
-  handle is actually part of it even when the handle is moved to the
-  pending/msgsent lists. It needs to know which multi handle it belongs
-  to, if for example curl_easy_cleanup() is called before the handle is
-  removed from the multi handle.
-
-  Alll 'data->multi' pointers of handles still part of the multi handle
-  gets cleared by curl_multi_cleanup() which "orphans" all previously
-  attached easy handles.

-  - add QUIC/ngtcp2 detection in CMake with wolfSSL.
-
-    Because wolfSSL uses zlib if available, move compression detection
-    before TLS detection. (OpenSSL might also need this in the future.)
-
-  - wolfSSL 5.5.0 started using C99 types in its `quic.h` header, but it
-    doesn't #include the necessary C99 header itself, breaking builds

-- tests: make first.c the same for both lib tests and unit tests
-
-  The only difference used to be global variable used in unittest tests.
-  After cb7ed5a removed individual flag overrides for the unittests, first.c
-  was no longer recompiled for unit tests to include the flag, so whether it
-  worked or gave a link error depended on whether it was compiled in

-    tool_stderr.
-
-  Both freopen and overriding the stderr macro are necessary because if
-  the user-specified filename is "-" then stdout is assigned to

-- http2: fix handling of RST and GOAWAY to recognize partial transfers
-
-  - a reset transfer (HTTP/2 RST) did not always lead to the proper
-    error message on receiving its response, leading to wrong reports
-    of a successful transfer
-  - test_05_02 was able to trigger this condition with increased transfer
-    count. The simulated response errors did not carry a 'Content-Length'
-    so only proper RST handling could detect the abort
-  - When doing such transfers in parallel, a connection could enter the
-    state where
-    a) it had been closed (GOAWAY received)
-    b) the RST had not been "seen" for the transfer yet
-    or c) the GOAWAY announced an error and the last successful
-    stream id was not checked against ongoing transfers
-
-  Closes #10693
-
-- tests: use dynamic ports numbers in pytest suite
-
-  - necessary ports are bound at start of test suite and then
-    given to server fixtures for use.
-  - this make parallel use of pytest (in separate directories),
-    practically safe for use as OS tend to not reuse such port numbers
-    for a while
-
-  Closes #10692
-
-- connect: fix time_connect and time_appconnect timer statistics
-
-  - time_connect was not updated when the overall connection failed,
-    e.g. when SSL verification was unsuccessful, refs #10670
-  - rework gather those values to interrogate involved filters,
-    also from all eyeballing attempts, to report the maximum of
-    those values.
-  - added 3 test cases in test_06 to check reported values on
-    successful, partially failed and totally failed connections.

-- rand: use arc4random as fallback when available
-
-  Normally curl uses cryptographically strong random provided by the
-  selected SSL backend. If compiled without SSL support, a naive built-in
-  function was used instead.
-
-  Generally this was okay, but it will result in some downsides for non-
-  SSL builds, such as predictable temporary file names.
-
-  This change ensures that arc4random will be used instead, if available.
-
-  Closes #10672

-Grisha Levit (6 Mar 2023)

-- tool: dump headers even if file is write-only
-
-  The fixes in #10079 brought a (seemingly unrelated) change of open mode
-  from `wb`/`ab` to `wb+`/`ab+` for the headerfile. This makes it no
-  longer possible to write the header file to e.g. a pipe, like:
-
-      curl -D >(grep ...) file:///dev/null
-
-  Which presently results in `Warning: Failed to open /dev/fd/63`
-
-  See #10079
-  Closes #10675

The diff between `curl-8.3.0` and `curl-8.4.0` reveals several changes with potential security implications. The most critical one identified is related to a SOCKS proxy vulnerability (CVE-2023-38545).

Here's a summary of the security-relevant changes:

*   **CVE-2023-38545 (SOCKS hostname too long for remote resolve):** This fix addresses a security issue where a hostname longer than 255 characters was mishandled during SOCKS remote resolution, leading to a vulnerability.
*   **IDN Null Pointer Dereference:** Fixes a null pointer dereference in the IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) handling when a bad hostname is provided or `idn2_check_version` returns NULL.
*   **Large Headers Handling:** Changes related to using a per-request counter for checking excessively large headers, which could prevent denial-of-service or resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **Random String Generation:** A fix for an off-by-one error in random string generation (`rand: fix 'alnum': array is too small to include a terminating null character`), which could have implications for the randomness of generated values used in security-sensitive contexts.
*   **Debug Function Inheritance in DoH:** The change to inherit `DEBUGFUNCTION/DATA` in DoH (DNS over HTTPS) transfers could potentially expose sensitive information if the debug function logs such data.
*   **TFTPD String Operation Overread:** A fix in `tftpd.c` to always use curl's own `tftp.h` to avoid a `-Wstringop-overread` warning, which indicates a potential buffer over-read vulnerability.
*   **CURL_DISABLE_BEARER_AUTH breakage:** Fixes a logical error when bearer authentication was disabled.

I will now proceed to investigate the `socks` vulnerability (CVE-2023-38545) in more detail by examining the code changes in `lib/socks.c`.

The diff for `lib/socks.c` clearly shows the fix for CVE-2023-38545.

**Vulnerability:**

In `curl-8.3.0/lib/socks.c`, specifically in the `Curl_SOCKS5_connect` function, when a hostname for a SOCKS5 proxy was longer than 255 characters and remote resolution was attempted, the code would fall back to local resolution. However, this fallback was not handled correctly, leading to a security issue. The `infof` call would log a message, and `socks5_resolve_local` would be set to `TRUE`, but the process would continue, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read due to the oversized hostname being copied into a fixed-size buffer.

**Patched Version (`curl-8.4.0`):**

The patch introduces a critical change:

         len += hostname_len;\
       }\
```

Instead of attempting a flawed local resolution, the patched version now explicitly returns `CURLPX_LONG_HOSTNAME` using `failf(data, ...)`. This prevents the vulnerable code path from being taken when the hostname is too long for remote resolution.

Additionally, the cast for `hostname_len` when copying it into `socksreq` was changed from `(char)` to `(unsigned char)`. While `hostname_len` is checked to be less than or equal to 255, using `unsigned char` is more semantically correct for a length value and avoids any potential signed/unsigned conversion issues, although it's not the primary fix for the vulnerability.

**Security Implications:**

The original vulnerability (CVE-2023-38545) could lead to an out-of-bounds read. By returning an error immediately when the hostname is too long, the patched version prevents this memory corruption, thus mitigating a potential denial-of-service or information disclosure vulnerability.

I will now store these findings in shared memory.

The diff for `lib/idn.c` shows two changes related to IDN handling.

**Vulnerability (Implicit):**

In `curl-8.3.0/lib/idn.c`, there's an implicit vulnerability related to the `idn2_check_version` function. If `idn2_check_version` returns `NULL` (indicating a too old or problematic `libidn2` version), the code would proceed without `result` being set to an error. This could lead to `decoded` (which would normally point to the punycode) remaining `NULL` and being dereferenced later, causing a crash or access violation.

**Patched Version (`curl-8.4.0`):**

The patch introduces two key changes:

1.  **Early Exit for `idn2_check_version`:**
    ```diff
    --- curl-8.3.0/lib/idn.c	2023-09-08 16:03:36.000000000 +0000
    +++ curl-8.4.0/lib/idn.c	2023-10-07 21:08:00.000000000 +0000

         else
           return CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT;
       }
    +  else
    +    return CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT;
     
       return CURLE_OK;
     }
    ```
    This change adds an `else` block that immediately returns `CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT` if the initial `idn2_check_version` condition (which is implicitly checked by the preceding `if` block) is not met. This ensures that if `libidn2` is too old or problematic, an error is returned early.

2.  **Explicit Error for Old `libidn2`:**
    ```diff
    --- curl-8.3.0/lib/idn.c	2023-09-08 16:03:36.000000000 +0000
    +++ curl-8.4.0/lib/idn.c	2023-10-07 21:08:00.000000000 +0000

     #elif defined(USE_WIN32_IDN)
       result = win32_idn_to_ascii(input, &decoded);
     #endif
    ```
    This addition explicitly sets `result = CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN` if `idn2_check_version` (which is implicitly checked by the `#if defined(USE_LIBIDN2)` block) indicates a too old `libidn2` version. This provides a more specific error code.

**Security Implications:**

The original code could lead to a null pointer dereference if `idn2_check_version` returned `NULL` and the `decoded` pointer was subsequently used. This could result in a crash (Denial of Service). The patches prevent this by ensuring an error is returned before such a dereference can occur.

I will now store these findings in shared memory.
