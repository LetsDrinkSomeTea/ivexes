+- socks: return error if hostname too long for remote resolve
+
+  Prior to this change the state machine attempted to change the remote
+  resolve to a local resolve if the hostname was longer than 255
+  characters. Unfortunately that did not work as intended and caused a
+  security issue.
+
+  Bug: https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html

+
+- CI: remove slowed-network tests
+
+  - remove these tests as they are currently not reliable in our CI
+    setups.
+
+  curl handles the test cases, but CI sometimes fails on these due to
+  additional conditions. Rather than mix them in, an additional CI job
+  will be added in the future that is specific to them.

+    builds from libcurl-env into a separate document libcurl-env-dbg.
+
+  - Document more debug environment variables.

+
+  autotools detects this anyway for display purposes.
+  CMake detects this to decide whether to use the BoringSSL-specific

+
+  Without this warning the user may assume that the only handles their
+  debug callback receives are the easy handles on which they set
+  CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION.

+
+  Prior to this change a failed conversion erroneously returned CURLE_OK

+
+- tests: propagate errors in libtests
+
+  Use the test macros to automatically propagate some errors, and check
+  and log others while running the tests. This can help in debugging
+  exactly why a test has failed.
+
+- tests: set --expect100-timeout to improve test reliability
+
+  On an overloaded server, the default 1 second timeout can go by without
+  the test server having a chance to respond with the expected headers,
+  causing tests to fail. Increase the 1 second timeout to 99 seconds so
+  this failure mode is no longer a problem on test 1129. Some other tests
+  already set a high value, but make them consistently 99 seconds so if
+  something goes wrong the test is stalled for less time.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- CI: ignore the "flaky" and "timing-dependent" test results in CMake
+
+  This was already done for automake builds but CMake builds were missed.
+  Test 1086 actually causes the test harness to crash with:
+
+  Warning: unable to close filehandle DWRITE properly: Broken pipe at C:/projec
+  ts/curl/tests/ftpserver.pl line 527
+
+  Rather than fix it now, this change leaves test 1086 entirely skipped on
+  those builds that show this problem.

+- cmake: improve OpenLDAP builds
+
+  - cmake: detect OpenLDAP based on function `ldap_init_fd`.
+    autotools does this. autotools also publishes this detection result
+    in `HAVE_LDAP_INIT_FD`. We don't mimic that with CMake as the source
+    doesn't use this value. (it might need to be remove-listed in
+    `scripts/cmp-config.pl` for future OpenLDAP test builds.)
+    This also deletes existing self-declaration method via the
+    CMake-specific `CURL_USE_OPENLDAP` configuration.
+
+  - cmake: define `LDAP_DEPRECATED=1` for OpenLDAP.
+    Like autotools does. This fixes a long list of these warnings:
+    ```
+    /usr/local/opt/openldap/include/ldap.h:1049:5: warning: 'LDAP_DEPRECATED' i
+  s not defined, evaluates to 0 [-Wundef]
+    ```
+
+  - cmake: delete LDAP TODO comment no longer relevant.
+
+  Also:
+
+  - autotools: replace domain name `dummy` with `0.0.0.0` in LDAP feature
+    detection functions.
+
+  Ref: #11964 (effort to sync cmake detections with autotools)
+
+  Closes #12024

+- cmake: fix unity builds for more build combinations
+
+  By using unique static function/variable names in source files

+- tests: remove leading spaces from some tags
+
+  The threee tags `<name>`, `</name>` and `<command>` were frequently used
+  with a leading space that this removes. The reason this habbit is so
+  widespread in testcases is probably that they have been copy and pasted.
+
+  Hence, fixing them all now might curb this practice from now on.

+- cmake: fix unity with Windows Unicode + TrackMemory
+
+  Found the root cause of the startup crash in unity builds with Unicode
+  and TrackMemory enabled at the same time.
+
+  We must make sure that the `memdebug.h` header doesn't apply to
+  `lib/curl_multibyte.c` (as even noted in a comment there.) In unity
+  builds all headers apply to all sources, including `curl_multibyte.c`.
+  This probably resulted in an infinite loop on startup.
+
+  Exclude this source from unity compilation with TrackMemory enabled,
+  in both libcurl and curl tool. Enable unity mode for a debug Unicode
+  CI job to keep it tested. Also delete the earlier workaround that
+  fully disabled unity for affected builds.

+- cmake: disable unity mode with Windows Unicode + TrackMemory
+
+  "TrackMemory" is `ENABLE_DEBUG=ON` (aka `ENABLE_CURLDEBUG=ON`,
+  aka `-DCURLDEBUG`).
+
+  There is an issue with memory tracking and Unicode when built in "unity"
+  mode, which results in the curl tool crashing right on startup, even
+  without any command-line option. Interestingly this doesn't happen under
+  WINE (at least on the system I tested this on), but consistenly happens
+  on real Windows machines. Crash is 0xC0000374 heap corruption. Both

+- appveyor: rewrite batch in PowerShell + CI improvements
+
+  1. Rewrite in PowerShell:
+
+  - rewrite MS-DOS batch build script in PowerShell.
+  - move some bash operations into native PowerShell.
+  - fixups for PowerShell insisting on failure when a command outputs
+    something to stderr.
+  - fix to actually run `curl -V` after every build.
+    (and exclude ARM64 builds.)
+  - also say why we skipped `curl -V` if we had to skip.
+  - fix CMake warnings about unused configuration variables, by adapting
+    these dynamically for build cases.
+  - dedupe OpenSSL path into a variable.
+  - disable `test1451` failing with a warning anyway due to missing python
+    impacket. (after trying and failing to install impacket)
+    PowerShell promotes these warnings to errors by PowerShell. We can also
+    suppress they wholesale if they start causing issues in the future,
+    like we already to with `autoreconf` and `./configure`.
+
+  PowerShell is better than MS-DOS batches, so the hope is this makes it
+  easier to extend and maintain the AppVeyor build logic. POSIX/bash isn't
+  supported inline by AppVeyor on Windows build machines, but we are okay
+  to keep it in an external script, so it's also an option.
+
+  2. CI improvements:
+
+  - enable tests for a "unity" build job.
+  - speed-up CI initialization by using shallow clones of the curl repo.
+  - speed-up CMake MSVC jobs with `TrackFileAccess=false`.
+  - enable parallelism in `VisualStudioSolution` builds.
+  - display CMake version before builds.
+  - always show the CPU in job names.
+  - tell which jobs are build-only in job names.
+  - move `TESTING:` value next to `DISABLED_TESTS:` in two jobs.
+  - add `config.log` (autotools) to dumped logs (need to enable manually).
+
+  3. Style:
+
+  - use single-quotes in YAML like we do in other CI YAML files.
+    It also allows to drop quoting characters and lighter to write/read.
+    (keep double quotes for PowerShell strings needing expansion.)
+
+  Closes #11999
+
+- cmake: fix `HAVE_LDAP_SSL`, `HAVE_LDAP_URL_PARSE` on non-Windows
+
+  - set `HAVE_LDAP_URL_PARSE` if `ldap_url_parse` function exists.
+    Before this patch we set it based it on the presence of `stricmp`,
+    which correctly enabled it on e.g. Windows, but was inaccurate for
+    other platforms.
+
+  - always set `HAVE_LDAP_SSL` if an LDAP backend is detected and
+    LDAPS is not explicitly disabled. This mimics autotools behaviour.
+    Previously we set it only for Windows LDAP. After this fix, LDAPS is
+    correctly enabled in default macOS builds.
+
+  - enable LDAP[S] for a CMake macOS CI job. Target OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)
+    to avoid deprecation warnings for LDAP API.
+
+  - always detect `HAVE_LDAP_SSL_H`, even with LDAPS explicitly disabled.
+    This doesn't make much sense, but let's do it to sync behaviour with
+    autotools.
+
+  - fix benign typo in variable name.

+- autotools: restore `HAVE_IOCTL_*` detections

+  c3456652a0c72d1845d08df9769667db7e159949 (2022-08), because the
+  `HAVE_IOCTL` result it generated was unused in the source. But,
+  I did miss the fact that this had two dependent checks:
+  `CURL_CHECK_FUNC_IOCTL_FIONBIO`,
+  `CURL_CHECK_FUNC_IOCTL_SIOCGIFADDR` that we do actually need:
+  `HAVE_IOCTL_FIONBIO`, `HAVE_IOCTL_SIOCGIFADDR`.

+- cmake: detect `HAVE_GETADDRINFO_THREADSAFE`

+  Based on existing autotools logic.
+
+  autotools checks for old versions of the allowlisted target OSes and

+  on newer systems and enable regardless of OS version.
+
+  autotools always runs all 3 probes for non-fast-tracked systems and
+  enables this feature if any one of them was successful. To save
+  configuration time,  CMake stops at the first successful check.
+
+  OpenBSD is not fast-tracked and then gets blocklisted as a generic BSD
+  system. I haven't double-checked if this is correct, but looks odd.

+
+  - copy libcurl DLL next to curl tool and tests binaries in shared mode.
+    This makes it possible to run the tests. (We don't run tests after
+    these builds yet.)
+
+  - list the DLLs and EXEs present after the builds.
+
+  - add `DEBUG` variable for CMake builds to allow disabling it, for
+    testing non-debug builds. (currently enabled for all)
+
+  - add commented lines that dump CMake configuration logs for debugging
+    build/auto-detection issues.
+
+  - add gcc version to jobs where missing.
+
+  - switch a job to the native MSYS2 mingw-w64 toolchain. This adds gcc 9

+- tool: use our own stderr variable
+
+  Earlier this year we changed our own stderr variable to use the standard

+  the curl-tool specific variable). This solution needed to override the
+  standard `stderr` symbol via the preprocessor. This in turn didn't play
+  well with unity builds and caused curl tool to crash or stay silent due
+  to an uninitialized stderr. This was a hard to find issue, fixed by
+  manually breaking out one file from the unity sources.
+
+  To avoid two these two tricks, this patch implements a different
+  solution: Restore using our own local variable for our stderr output and
+  leave `stderr` as-is. To avoid using `stderr` by mistake, add a
+  `checksrc` rule (based on logic we already used in lib for `strerror`)
+  that detects any `stderr` use in `src` and points to using our own
+  variable instead: `tool_stderr`.

+- openssl: improve ssl shutdown handling
+
+  - If SSL shutdown is not finished then make an additional call to
+    SSL_read to gather additional tracing.
+
+  - Fix http2 and h2-proxy filters to forward do_close() calls to the next
+    filter.
+
+  For example h2 and SSL shutdown before and after this change:
+
+  Before:
+
+  Curl_conn_close -> cf_hc_close -> Curl_conn_cf_discard_chain ->
+  ssl_cf_destroy
+
+  After:
+
+  Curl_conn_close -> cf_hc_close -> cf_h2_close -> cf_setup_close ->
+  ssl_cf_close

+  closure handle. Refer to discussion in #11878.

+- libssh2: fix error message on failed pubkey-from-file
+
+  - If libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex returns -1 then show error
+    message "SSH public key authentication failed: Reason unknown (-1)".
+
+  When libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex returns -1 it does so as a
+  generic error and therefore doesn't set an error message. AFAICT that is
+  not documented behavior.
+
+  Prior to this change libcurl retrieved the last set error message which
+  would be from a previous function failing. That resulted in misleading
+  auth failed error messages in verbose mode.

+- tftpd: always use curl's own tftp.h
+
+  Using the system's provided arpa/tftp.h and optimizing, GCC 12 detects
+  and reports a stringop-overread warning:
+
+  tftpd.c: In function ‘write_behind.isra’:
+  tftpd.c:485:12: warning: ‘write’ reading between 1 and 2147483647 bytes f
+  rom a region of size 0 [-Wstringop-overread]
+    485 |     return write(test->ofile, writebuf, count);
+        |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+  In file included from tftpd.c:71:
+  /usr/include/arpa/tftp.h:58:30: note: source object ‘tu_data’ of size 0

+  ng */
+        |                              ^~~~~~~
+
+  This occurs because writebuf points to this field and the latter
+  cannot be considered as being of dynamic length because it is not
+  the last field in the structure. Thus it is bound to its declared
+  size.
+
+  This commit always uses curl's own version of tftp.h where the
+  target field is last in its structure, effectively avoiding the
+  warning.
+
+  As HAVE_ARPA_TFTP_H is not used anymore, cmake/configure checks for
+  arpa/tftp.h are removed.

+- CI: ignore the "flaky" and "timing-dependent" test results
+
+  CI builds will now run these tests, but will ignore the results if they

+  Prior this change curl used to create random hex strings. This was

+
+  The MIME multipart boundary used to be mere 64-bits of randomness due

+
+  This is a follow-up to 291d225a which changed Curl_isunreserved into an
+  alias macro for ISUNRESERVED. The problem is the former is not easily
+  identified as a macro by the caller, which could lead to a bug.

+- tests: increase the default server logs lock timeout
+
+  This timeout is used to wait for the server to finish writing its logs
+  before checking them against the expected values. An overloaded machine
+  could take more than the two seconds previously allocated, so increase
+  the timeout to 5 seconds.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+  Closes #11834
+
+- tests: increase TEST_HANG_TIMEOUT in two tests
+
+  These tests had a 5 second timeout compared to 60 seconds for all other
+  tests. Make these consistent with the others for more reliability on
+  heavily-loaded machines.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- test1056: disable on Windows
+
+  This test relies on the IPv6 scope field being ignored when connecting to
+  ipv6-localhost (i.e. [::1%259999] is treated as [::1]). Maybe this is a bit
+  dodgy, but it works on all our test platforms except Windows. This
+  test was disabled manually on all Windows CI builds already, so instead
+  add an incompatible feature and precheck so it's skipped on Windows
+  everywhere automatically.
+
+- test587: add a slight delay after test
+
+  This test is designed to connect to the server, then immediately send a
+  few bytes and disconnect. In some situations, such as on a loaded
+  server, this doesn't give the server enough time to write its lock file
+  before its existence is checked. The test harness then fails to find the
+  server's input log file (because it hasn't been written yet) and fails
+  the test. By adding a short delay after the test, the HTTP server has
+  enough time to write its lock file which gives itself more time to write
+  its remaining files.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- tests: stop overriding the lock timeout
+
+  These tests reduce the server lock wait timeout which can increase
+  flakiness on loaded machines. Since this is merely an optimization,
+  eliminate them in favour of reliability.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- tests: add some --expect100-timeout to reduce timing dependencies
+
+  These tests can fail when the test machine is so slow that the test HTTP
+  server didn't get a chance to complete before the client's one second
+  100-continue timeout triggered. Increase that 1 second to 999 seconds so
+  this situation doesn't happen.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- test661: return from test early in case of curl error
+
+- tests: add the timing-dependent keyword on several tests
+
+  These are ones likely to fail on heavily-loaded machines that alter the
+  normal test timing. Most of these tests already had the flaky keyword
+  since this condition makes them more likely to fail on CI.
+
+- test1592: greatly increase the maximum test timeout
+
+  It was too short to be reliable on heavily loaded CI machines, and
+  as a fail-safe only, it didn't need to be short.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- test: minor test cleanups
+
+  Remove an obsolete block of code in tests 2032 & 576.
+  Add a comment in test 1474.
+
+- tests: quadruple the %FTPTIME2 and %FTPTIME3 timeouts
+
+  This gives more of a margin for error when running on overloaded CI
+  servers.
+
+  Ref: #11328
+
+- tests: improve SLOWDOWN test reliability by reducing sent data
+
+  These tests are run in SLOWDOWN mode which adds a 10 msec delay after
+  each character output, which means it takes at least 1.6 seconds (and
+  320 kernel calls) just to get through the long welcome banner. On an
+  overloaded system, this can end up taking much more than 1.6 seconds,
+  and even more than the 7 or 16 second curl timeout that the tests rely
+  on, causing them to fail. Reducing the size of the welcome banner drops
+  the total number of characters sent before the transfer starts by more
+  than half, which reduces the opportunity for test-breaking slowdowns by
+  the same amount.

-- cmake: picky-linker fixes for openssl, ZLIB, H3 and more
-
-  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with OpenSSL/quictls built with ZLIB.
-    (Requires curl be built with ZLIB option also.)
-
-  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with OpenSSL/quictls/LibreSSL and `ld`
-    linker on Windows.
-
-  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with wolfSSL to automatically add
-    `ws2_32` to the lib list on Windows. For all linkers.
-
-  - reposition ZLIB (and other compression) detection _after_ TLS
-    detection, but before calling HTTP/3-support detection via
-    `CheckQuicSupportInOpenSSL`.
-
-    May be a regression from ebef55a61df0094b9790710a42f63c48e7de3c13
-    May fix #10832 (Reported-by: Micah Snyder)
-
-    This also seems to fix an odd case, where OpenSSL/quictls is correctly
-    detected, but its header path is not set while compiling, breaking
-    build at `src/curl_ntlm_core.c`. Reason for this remains undiscovered.
-
-  - satisfy "picky" linkers such as `ld` with MinGW, that are highly
-    sensitive to lib order, by also adding brotli to the beginning of the
-    lib list.
-
-  - satisfy "picky" linkers by adding certain Windows systems libs to
-    the lib list for OpenSSL/LibreSSL. (Might need additional ones for
-    other forks, such as `pthread` for BoringSSL.)
-
-  Note: It'd make sense to _always_ add `ws2_32`, `crypt32` (except
-  Windows App targets perhaps?), `bcrypt` (except old-mingw!) on Windows
-  at this point. They are almost always required, and if some aren't,
-  they are ignored by the linker with no effect on final binaries.

-- lib: add `bufq` and `dynhds`
-
-  Adding `bufq`:
-  - at init() time configured to hold up to `n` chunks of `m` bytes each.
-  - various methods for reading from and writing to it.
-  - `peek` support to get access to buffered data without copy
-  - `pass` support to allow buffer flushing on write if it becomes full
-  - use case: IO buffers for dynamic reads and writes that do not blow up
-  - distinct from `dynbuf` in that:
-    - it maintains a read position
-    - writes on a full bufq return CURLE_AGAIN instead of nuking itself
-  - Init options:
-    - SOFT_LIMIT: allow writes into a full bufq
-    - NO_SPARES: free empty chunks right away
-  - a `bufc_pool` that can keep a number of spare chunks to
-    be shared between different `bufq` instances
-
-  Adding `dynhds`:
-  - a straightforward list of name+value pairs as used for HTTP headers
-  - headers can be appended dynamically
-  - headers can be removed again
-  - headers can be replaced
-  - headers can be looked up
-  - http/1.1 formatting into a `dynbuf`
-  - configured at init() with limits on header counts and total string
-    sizes
-  - use case: pass a HTTP request or response around without being version
-    specific
-  - express a HTTP request without a curl easy handle (used in h2 proxy
-    tunnels)

-    - conversions of `dynhds` to nghttp2/nghttp3 name+value arrays

-- multi: remove PENDING + MSGSENT handles from the main linked list
-
-  As they are not driving transfers or any socket activity, the main loop

-
-  They are instead only held in their own separate lists.
-
-  'data->multi' is kept a pointer to the multi handle as long as the easy
-  handle is actually part of it even when the handle is moved to the
-  pending/msgsent lists. It needs to know which multi handle it belongs
-  to, if for example curl_easy_cleanup() is called before the handle is
-  removed from the multi handle.
-
-  Alll 'data->multi' pointers of handles still part of the multi handle
-  gets cleared by curl_multi_cleanup() which "orphans" all previously
-  attached easy handles.

-  This is take 2. The first version was reverted for the 8.0.1 release.

-- wolfssl: add quic/ngtcp2 detection in cmake, and fix builds
-
-  - add QUIC/ngtcp2 detection in CMake with wolfSSL.
-
-    Because wolfSSL uses zlib if available, move compression detection
-    before TLS detection. (OpenSSL might also need this in the future.)
-
-  - wolfSSL 5.5.0 started using C99 types in its `quic.h` header, but it
-    doesn't #include the necessary C99 header itself, breaking builds
-    (unless another dependency pulled it by chance.) Add local workaround

-    header detection first. Ref: #10745

-- tests: make first.c the same for both lib tests and unit tests
-
-  The only difference used to be global variable used in unittest tests.
-  After cb7ed5a removed individual flag overrides for the unittests, first.c
-  was no longer recompiled for unit tests to include the flag, so whether it
-  worked or gave a link error depended on whether it was compiled in

-  - In tool_setup.h override stdio.h's stderr macro as global variable
-    tool_stderr.
-
-  Both freopen and overriding the stderr macro are necessary because if
-  the user-specified filename is "-" then stdout is assigned to
-  tool_stderr and no freopen takes place. See the PR for more information.

-- doc: fix compiler warning in libcurl.m4
-
-  Current test for curl_free() may produce warnings with strict compiler
-  flags or even with default compiler flags with upcoming versions.
-  These warning could turned into errors by -Werror or similar flags.
-  Such warnings/errors are avoided by this patch.

-- ftp: active mode with SSL, add the damn filter
-
-  - since 7.87.0 we lost adding the SSL filter for an active
-    FTP connection that uses SSL. This leads to hangers and timeouts
-    as reported in #10666.

-- url: fix logic in connection reuse to deny reuse on "unclean" connections
-
-  - add parameter to `conn_is_alive()` cfilter method that returns
-    if there is input data waiting on the connection
-  - refrain from re-using connnection from the cache that have
-    input pending
-  - adapt http/2 and http/3 alive checks to digest pending input
-    to check the connection state
-  - remove check_cxn method from openssl as that was just doing
-    what the socket filter now does.
-  - add tests for connection reuse with special server configs
-
-  Closes #10690

-- http2: fix handling of RST and GOAWAY to recognize partial transfers
-
-  - a reset transfer (HTTP/2 RST) did not always lead to the proper
-    error message on receiving its response, leading to wrong reports
-    of a successful transfer
-  - test_05_02 was able to trigger this condition with increased transfer
-    count. The simulated response errors did not carry a 'Content-Length'
-    so only proper RST handling could detect the abort
-  - When doing such transfers in parallel, a connection could enter the
-    state where
-    a) it had been closed (GOAWAY received)
-    b) the RST had not been "seen" for the transfer yet
-    or c) the GOAWAY announced an error and the last successful
-    stream id was not checked against ongoing transfers
-
-  Closes #10693
-
-- tests: use dynamic ports numbers in pytest suite
-
-  - necessary ports are bound at start of test suite and then
-    given to server fixtures for use.
-  - this make parallel use of pytest (in separate directories),
-    practically safe for use as OS tend to not reuse such port numbers
-    for a while
-
-  Closes #10692
-
-- connect: fix time_connect and time_appconnect timer statistics
-
-  - time_connect was not updated when the overall connection failed,
-    e.g. when SSL verification was unsuccessful, refs #10670
-  - rework gather those values to interrogate involved filters,
-    also from all eyeballing attempts, to report the maximum of
-    those values.
-  - added 3 test cases in test_06 to check reported values on
-    successful, partially failed and totally failed connections.

-- rand: use arc4random as fallback when available
-
-  Normally curl uses cryptographically strong random provided by the
-  selected SSL backend. If compiled without SSL support, a naive built-in
-  function was used instead.
-
-  Generally this was okay, but it will result in some downsides for non-
-  SSL builds, such as predictable temporary file names.
-
-  This change ensures that arc4random will be used instead, if available.
-
-  Closes #10672
-
-Grisha Levit (6 Mar 2023)
-
-- tool: dump headers even if file is write-only
-
-  The fixes in #10079 brought a (seemingly unrelated) change of open mode
-  from `wb`/`ab` to `wb+`/`ab+` for the headerfile. This makes it no
-  longer possible to write the header file to e.g. a pipe, like:
-
-      curl -D >(grep ...) file:///dev/null
-
-  Which presently results in `Warning: Failed to open /dev/fd/63`
-
-  See #10079
-  Closes #10675

### High-Level Diff Summary: curl-8.3.0 → curl-8.4.0

#### 1. **Security-Relevant Changes**

- **SOCKS Hostname Length Handling (CVE-2023-38545)**
  - In the `CHANGES` and `RELEASE-NOTES` files, a critical security fix is referenced:
    - **"socks: return error if hostname too long for remote resolve"**
    - Previously, if a hostname was longer than 255 characters, the state machine would attempt to fall back to a local resolve, which did not work as intended and caused a security issue.
    - **Reference:** [CVE-2023-38545](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html)
    - **Impact:** This is a major security fix for SOCKS proxy handling, preventing a potentially exploitable state confusion or buffer issue.

- **IDN Handling Fixes**
  - WinIDN: Return `CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT` if IDN hostname cannot be converted from UTF-8 to UTF-16, preventing NULL pointer dereference.
  - If `idn2_check_version` returns NULL, now returns error to avoid NULL dereference.

- **LDAP/LDAPS and CA Path Handling**
  - CA path support now explicitly includes wolfSSL in addition to OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and mbedTLS.
  - The default CA path logic and error messages were updated to reflect this.
  - LDAP detection and configuration logic improved for better security and compatibility.

#### 2. **New Features & API Additions**

- **IPFS Protocol Support**
  - Added support for `ipfs://` and `ipns://` URLs via HTTP gateway (see CHANGES/RELEASE-NOTES).
- **New API:**
  - `curl_multi_get_handles` function added to libcurl.

#### 3. **Build System and Dependency Changes**

- **CMake and Autotools:**
  - Many checks for standard C headers removed (assumed present).
  - Improved detection and configuration for SSL/TLS backends, especially for TLS-SRP, OpenLDAP, and CA paths.
  - Added support for AWS-LC and BoringSSL in QUIC/HTTP3 builds.
  - Improved macOS linking: now also links with CoreServices when linking with CoreFoundation.
  - Removed support for legacy mingw (mingw.org).

#### 4. **Other Security/Robustness Improvements**

- **Improved Error Handling:**
  - Various places now check for error returns and handle them more robustly, especially in network and protocol code.
- **Buffer/Memory Safety:**
  - Several changes to avoid buffer overflows, NULL dereferences, and use of uninitialized memory.
- **Test Suite Improvements:**
  - Many tests updated for reliability and to cover new/changed behaviors.

---

## Security-Relevant Code Changes: Key Locations

### SOCKS Proxy Hostname Length (CVE-2023-38545)
- **Summary:** Now returns an error if a hostname is too long for remote resolve, instead of attempting a fallback that could lead to security issues.
- **Relevant File(s):** (Implementation likely in `lib/socks.c` or related, but the CHANGES/RELEASE-NOTES document the fix.)

### IDN Handling
- **Summary:** Prevents NULL pointer dereference by checking conversion results and version checks.
- **Relevant File(s):** `lib/idn.c`

### LDAP/LDAPS and CA Path
- **Summary:** CA path support extended to wolfSSL; improved detection and error messages.
- **Relevant Files:** `CMakeLists.txt`, `acinclude.m4`, `configure.ac`, `configure`

### Other Notable Security/Robustness Fixes
- **NULL Dereference and Buffer Overflows:** Multiple places in the codebase, including IDN, HTTP, and test code.
- **Build System:** Removal of legacy/unsafe code paths (e.g., mingw v1).

---

## Guidance for Security Specialist and Red Team Operator

### For Security Specialist:
- **Focus on:** The SOCKS proxy logic (CVE-2023-38545), IDN handling, and CA path logic for SSL/TLS.
- **Indicators:** Look for changes in error handling, buffer management, and protocol state machines.
- **Files of Interest:** `lib/socks.c`, `lib/idn.c`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `acinclude.m4`, `configure.ac`, `configure`

### For Red Team Operator:
- **Exploit Targets:** 
  - The old SOCKS proxy fallback logic (pre-8.4.0) could be exploited with long hostnames (>255 chars).
  - IDN handling with malformed or excessively long hostnames.
- **Test:** Sending long hostnames via SOCKS proxies, malformed IDN hostnames, and edge cases in CA path configuration.

---

## Next Steps

- **Deeper Code Analysis:** Review the actual implementation in `lib/socks.c` and `lib/idn.c` for the exact logic changes.
- **Store Findings:** Storing this diff summary and key file paths in shared memory for team reference.

---

**Storing in shared memory:**
- Key: `security_diff_summary`
- Value: (This message)

**Key vulnerable/changed files for further review:**
- `lib/socks.c`
- `lib/idn.c`
- `CMakeLists.txt`
- `acinclude.m4`
- `configure.ac`
- `configure`

Let me know if you want a detailed code-level diff for any of these files or further breakdown of the SOCKS or IDN logic!

- **IPFS Protocol Support**
  - Added support for `ipfs://` and `ipns://` URLs via HTTP gateway (see CHANGES/RELEASE-NOTES).
- **New API:**
  - `curl_multi_get_handles` function added to libcurl.

#### 3. **Build System and Dependency Changes**

- **CMake and Autotools:**
  - Many checks for standard C headers removed (assumed present).
  - Improved detection and configuration for SSL/TLS backends, especially for TLS-SRP, OpenLDAP, and CA paths.
  - Added support for AWS-LC and BoringSSL in QUIC/HTTP3 builds.
  - Improved macOS linking: now also links with CoreServices when linking with CoreFoundation.
  - Removed support for legacy mingw (mingw.org).

#### 4. **Other Security/Robustness Improvements**

- **Improved Error Handling:**
  - Various places now check for error returns and handle them more robustly, especially in network and protocol code.
- **Buffer/Memory Safety:**
  - Several changes to avoid buffer overflows, NULL dereferences, and use of uninitialized memory.
- **Test Suite Improvements:**
  - Many tests updated for reliability and to cover new/changed behaviors.

---

## Security-Relevant Code Changes: Key Locations

### SOCKS Proxy Hostname Length (CVE-2023-38545)
- **Summary:** Now returns an error if a hostname is too long for remote resolve, instead of attempting a fallback that could lead to security issues.
- **Relevant File(s):** (Implementation likely in `lib/socks.c` or related, but the CHANGES/RELEASE-NOTES document the fix.)

### IDN Handling
- **Summary:** Prevents NULL pointer dereference by checking conversion results and version checks.
- **Relevant File(s):** `lib/idn.c`

### LDAP/LDAPS and CA Path
- **Summary:** CA path support extended to wolfSSL; improved detection and error messages.
- **Relevant Files:** `CMakeLists.txt`, `acinclude.m4`, `configure.ac`, `configure`

### Other Notable Security/Robustness Fixes
- **NULL Dereference and Buffer Overflows:** Multiple places in the codebase, including IDN, HTTP, and test code.
- **Build System:** Removal of legacy/unsafe code paths (e.g., mingw v1).

## Guidance for Security Specialist and Red Team Operator

### For Security Specialist:
- **Focus on:** The SOCKS proxy logic (CVE-2023-38545), IDN handling, and CA path logic for SSL/TLS.
- **Indicators:** Look for changes in error handling, buffer management, and protocol state machines.
- **Files of Interest:** `lib/socks.c`, `lib/idn.c`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `acinclude.m4`, `configure.ac`, `configure`

### For Red Team Operator:
- **Exploit Targets:** 
  - The old SOCKS proxy fallback logic (pre-8.4.0) could be exploited with long hostnames (>255 chars).
  - IDN handling with malformed or excessively long hostnames.
- **Test:** Sending long hostnames via SOCKS proxies, malformed IDN hostnames, and edge cases in CA path configuration.

---

## Next Steps

- **Deeper Code Analysis:** Review the actual implementation in `lib/socks.c` and `lib/idn.c` for the exact logic changes.
- **Store Findings:** Storing this diff summary and key file paths in shared memory for team reference.

---

**Storing in shared memory:**
- Key: `security_diff_summary`
- Value: (This message)

**Key vulnerable/changed files for further review:**
- `lib/socks.c`
- `lib/idn.c`
- `CMakeLists.txt`
- `acinclude.m4`
- `configure.ac`
- `configure`

Let me know if you want a detailed code-level diff for any of these files or further breakdown of the SOCKS or IDN logic!

High-Level Diff Summary: curl-8.3.0 → curl-8.4.0

1. Security-Relevant Changes
- SOCKS Hostname Length Handling (CVE-2023-38545): Critical fix in SOCKS proxy logic to return error if hostname is too long for remote resolve. Previously, fallback logic could cause security issues.
- IDN Handling Fixes: Prevents NULL pointer dereference in IDN hostname conversion.
- LDAP/LDAPS and CA Path Handling: Improved support and error handling for CA paths, especially with wolfSSL.
- Other Security/Robustness Improvements: Improved error handling and buffer/memory safety in multiple locations.

Key vulnerable/changed files for further review:
- lib/socks.c
- lib/idn.c
- CMakeLists.txt
- acinclude.m4
- configure.ac
- configure

Exploit targets: Old SOCKS proxy fallback logic (pre-8.4.0) with long hostnames (>255 chars), IDN handling with malformed/long hostnames, CA path edge cases.

Next steps: Deeper code analysis of lib/socks.c and lib/idn.c for exact logic changes and exploitability.
