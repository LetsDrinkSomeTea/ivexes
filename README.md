## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for sandbox environments)
- Git
- LLM API access (OpenAI or compatible)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LetsDrinkSomeTea/ivexes.git
   cd ivexes
   ```

2. **Install in development mode:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **For development with additional tools:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Build container images:**
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file for API keys and sensitive configuration:

```bash
# Required API Configuration, this is preferred
LLM_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# OR this is used only for tracing if LLM_API_KEY is set
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# LLM Configuration
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
REASONING_MODEL=openai/o4-mini
MODEL_TEMPERATURE=0.3
```

It is also possible to define the general configuration in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
TRACE_NAME=ivexes

# Agent Configuration
MAX_TURNS=10

# Vector Database
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=builtin
CHROMA_PATH=/tmp/ivexes/chromadb

# Codebase Analysis (for vulnerability assessment)
CODEBASE_PATH=/path/to/your/test/codebase
VULNERABLE_CODEBASE_FOLDER=vulnerable-version
PATCHED_CODEBASE_FOLDER=patched-version

# Sandbox
SANDBOX_IMAGE=kali-ssh:latest
SETUP_ARCHIVE=/path/to/setup.tar.gz
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Agent Usage

#### Single Agent Analysis
```python
from ivexes.agents import SingleAgent
from ivexes.config import PartialSettings

# Configure for vulnerability analysis
settings = PartialSettings(
    model='openai/gpt-4o-mini',
    codebase_path='/path/to/test/codebase',
    vulnerable_folder='vulnerable-v1.0',
    patched_folder='patched-v1.1'
)

agent = SingleAgent(settings=settings)

# Interactive mode
await agent.run_interactive()

# Or streaming mode
await agent.run_streamed():
```

#### Multi-Agent Analysis
```python
from ivexes.agents import MultiAgent

agent = MultiAgent(settings=settings)
agent.run()
```

### Command Line Interface

IVEXES provides a comprehensive CLI through `examples/manual.py`:

```bash
# Get help about the CLI-tool
python examples/manual.py --help
```

### Configuration Options

It is possible to define global standards as environment variables or to pass them into the Agent.
Passed settings gets preferred over the environment variables.

#### Core Settings
- `MODEL`: Primary LLM model (default: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`)
- `REASONING_MODEL`: Model for planning component (default: `openai/o4-mini`)
- `MODEL_TEMPERATURE`: Model temperature 0.0-2.0 (default: 0.3)
- `MAX_TURNS`: Maximum agent conversation turns (default: 10)

#### Embedding & Vector Database
- `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`: `builtin`, `local` (fetched from SentenceTransformers), or `openai` (default: builtin)
- `CHROMA_PATH`: ChromaDB storage location

#### Analysis Configuration
- `CODEBASE_PATH`: Root directory containing vulnerable/patched code
- `VULNERABLE_CODEBASE_FOLDER`: Subdirectory with vulnerable version
- `PATCHED_CODEBASE_FOLDER`: Subdirectory with patched version

#### Sandbox Configuration
- `SETUP_ARCHIVE`: tgz-archive with necessary data to setup sandbox, gets unpacked at /tmp, afterwards /tmp/setup.sh is run.
- `SANDBOX_IMAGE`: Which docker image to use as the sandbox base.
