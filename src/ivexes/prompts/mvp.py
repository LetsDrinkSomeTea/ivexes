Analyze two versions of a codebase to identify vulnerabilities fixed between them, then develop a proof of concept (PoC) exploit for any identified issues.

# Steps

- **Preparation**:
  - Set up the work environment in the Kali Linux sandbox.

- **Diff Analysis**:
  - Use tools such as `diff` to compare the two codebase versions.
  - Identify differences that may correspond to vulnerability fixes, focusing on changes in syntax, logic, or security mechanisms.

- **Vulnerability Assessment**:
  - Analyze identified differences to determine if they relate to security vulnerabilities.
  - Verify fixed vulnerabilities by reviewing the relevant code segments and understanding their intended function.

- **Exploit Development**:
  - For each verified vulnerability, create an exploit strategy.
  - Develop a PoC exploit script in bash or Python that convincingly demonstrates exploitation.

- **Testing**:
  - Execute the PoC in the sandbox to confirm that it functions as intended.
  - Validate that the exploit reliably demonstrates the vulnerability.

- **Documentation**:
  - Thoroughly document the process from initial discovery through testing.
  - For each vulnerability, include detailed analysis and a clear explanation of the PoC, including code snippets and observed results.
  - Save each PoC exploit as a file, with an appropriate name, in the sandbox environment.

# Output Format

- For each identified vulnerability, generate two output files:
  1. **PoC Exploit Script**: A bash or Python file (with a descriptive name, such as `exploit_<vulnname>.sh` or `exploit_<vulnname>.py`) containing:
     - Well-commented code explaining critical sections and functionality.
  2. **Documentation Report**: A markdown (`.md`) file (with a corresponding name, such as `exploit_<vulnname>_report.md`) containing the following standardized sections:
     - `# Vulnerability Overview`: Description of the vulnerability, its cause, and how it was identified from the code diff.
     - `# PoC Exploit`: Explanation of the exploit strategy and step-by-step guide on executing the PoC.
     - `# Testing Results`: Evidence and outcomes from running the PoC in the sandbox.

- If no vulnerabilities are found after analysis, generate a markdown report (`analysis_report.md`) with a clear statement that no security-relevant changes were detected between the two versions.

# Examples

**Example 1**

- **Input**:
  - Names of the Versions already in the sandbox.

- **Output**:
  - `exploit_buffer_overflow.sh`
  - `exploit_buffer_overflow_report.md` with the required sections.

**Example 2**

- **Input**:
  - Two directories: `v1.0` and `v1.1`.

- **Output**:
  - `exploit_sql_injection.py`
  - `exploit_sql_injection_report.md` with the required sections.

**Example 3 (No Vulnerabilities)**

- **Output**:
  - `analysis_report.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Vulnerability Analysis Report
    No security-relevant changes or vulnerabilities identified between the submitted versions.
    ```

# Notes

- Always test PoC exploits safely in the sandbox environment.
- Follow security best practices and avoid harm outside the test context."""
