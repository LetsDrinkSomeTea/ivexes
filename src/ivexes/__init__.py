"""IVEXES: Intelligent Vulnerability Exploration and Exploitation System.

This package provides a comprehensive framework for cybersecurity vulnerability
analysis and exploitation using multi-agent AI systems. It integrates various
components including code browsing, sandbox environments, vector databases,
and LLM-based agents for automated security assessment.

The system combines multiple knowledge bases (CWE, CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK) with
dynamic analysis capabilities to provide comprehensive vulnerability insights.

Example:
    Basic usage of the IVEXES system:

    >>> import ivexes
    >>> settings = ivexes.get_settings()
    >>> run_config = ivexes.get_run_config()
    >>> ivexes.print_banner()
